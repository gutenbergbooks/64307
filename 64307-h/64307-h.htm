</div>

<p>There is no richer theme for children’s stories
than the miracle of Spring. The selections
in “The Emerald Story Book” aim to
serve the young reader’s interest in three ways.
Some of the myths and legends are interesting
or amusing because flowers, insects, or birds
are presented as personalities and emphasise
human qualities or feelings. Some of the stories
and poems contribute to the child’s store
of knowledge by attracting his attention to
some fact, beauty, or blessing in nature which
may have escaped his notice. Still others
make an appeal by suggesting or affirming the
abiding hope symbolised in the thought, “See
the land her Easter keeping.”</p>

<p>The child’s heart is filled with the joy of
spring,—with the rapture expressed in the
thrush’s song which Mrs. Ewing describes.
“Fresh water and green woods, ambrosial sunshine
and sun-flecked shade, chattering brooks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
and rustling leaves, glade and sward and dell.
Lichens and cool mosses, feathered ferns and
flowers. Green leaves! Green leaves! Joy!
Joy!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_SPRING-MAIDEN_AND_THE_FROST_GIANTS">THE SPRING-MAIDEN AND THE FROST GIANTS</h3>

</div>

<p>In their glittering palace of icebergs the
Frost Giants were planning to capture Iduna,
the fair Spring-Maiden, and the rare treasure
which she guarded. Hoar-Frost, North-Wind,
Sleet, Hail, and Blizzard were growing
restless, locked in their frozen waste-land
of the North. They longed to enter the
valley of Spring and bring desolation to the
fruitful fields.</p>

<p>“We are helpless unless we seize the Spring-Maiden
and take from her the casket of golden
apples,” said Giant Hoar-Frost. “So long as
she guards this life-giving fruit all nature will
rejoice; the birds will sing their foolish jubilees;
gay blossoms will flaunt in the meadows;
robes of green will bedeck the trees,
and the people will enjoy everlasting youth
and vigour.”</p>

<p>“What you say is true,” said Giant North-Wind.
“If once I could enter the groves of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the Spring-Maiden’s valley I’d howl so long
and loud that those tiresome birds would stop
their endless singing.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Giant Blizzard.
“You would need my help, I believe. One of
my early morning calls would turn the trembling
dew-drops into icicles, and change the
smiling faces of the brooks and rills into frozen
images!”</p>

<p>“Especially if I went with you,” added
Giant Sleet slyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I should expect to be accompanied by
you and your twin brother Hail,” nodded Blizzard.
“I know how easily you can lock the
grass and flowers in a casement of ice which
they couldn’t break, and Hail has a very
clever, quick way of cutting off all the leaves.
But the question now is how shall we capture
the Spring-Maiden whose apples keep the
valley fresh and fair and the people forever
young!”</p>

<p>For a few moments the Frost Giants were
silent. Many times they had tried to entrap
the fair Iduna and her treasure, but they had
always failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“I have it,” said Hoar-Frost. “We must secure
the help of Loki, the Prince of Mischief.
He lives in Asgard near the Spring-Maiden’s
groves, and people say he often visits Iduna in
order to refresh himself with one of her life-giving
apples. Let us capture him first and
then compel him to help us. We giants are
fast growing old! The magic apples would
renew our strength for years to come!”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” said North-Wind, Blizzard,
Sleet, and Hail in one voice. “Loki first and
then Iduna!”</p>

<p>After much discussion it was decided that
Blizzard should undertake to capture Loki.</p>

<p>A short time after the council of the Frost-Giants,
Loki, the Prince of Mischief, was
amusing himself with a great fire which he
had built on one of the hills just beyond the
city of Asgard. Several times he stopped and
peered into the sky to see what caused the huge
shadow which seemed to hover near him. He
could see nothing but a gigantic eagle whirling
around the summit of the hill. Loki left
his fire to gather another bundle of faggots.
Suddenly the great bird swooped down very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
near him. He quickly seized a long stake and
struck the intruder across the back. To Loki’s
amazement one end of the stake stuck fast to
the eagle’s plumage and the Prince of Mischief
could not loosen his hands from the end
which he held. The eagle spread its huge
dark wings and flew away over rocks and hills
far to the North.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” screamed the terrified Loki,
but although he struggled with all his might
he could not escape from his captor.</p>

<p>When they reached a very lonely spot the
eagle alighted on a mountain peak and from
the black plumage stepped the Storm Giant,
Blizzard, who said:</p>

<p>“Loki, you are in my power and you shall
not escape until you promise to help the Frost
Giants in a very difficult undertaking!”</p>

<p>“What is that?” gasped the bruised and
terrified Loki.</p>

<p>“You must help us to capture Iduna, the
Spring-Maiden, and the treasure which she
guards. We cannot enter the valley of Spring
until Iduna is made our captive.”</p>

<p>“Help you to capture the treasure which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
gives life and youth to all who partake of it!”
said Loki. “Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Then away to the North we will go,” declared
the Storm Giant, putting on his eagle
plumage again.</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop!” cried Loki in terror. “Let
me think a moment!”</p>

<p>After a short consideration Loki took an
oath that he would betray Iduna and her treasure
into the hands of the Frost Giants. Then
the Prince of Mischief was freed, and back
to the North sped Blizzard.</p>

<p>The next day late in the afternoon, Iduna,
robed in a trailing garment of green and
crowned with a coronet of blossoms, was walking
through one of her loveliest groves. The
leaves were dancing to the music of a gentle
breeze. A delicious fragrance of hyacinths
and roses scented the valley. She sat down
near a cool fountain and placed her treasure-casket
of apples on the marble basin.</p>

<p>Presently a long shadow darkened the path
near her, and looking up quickly the Spring-Maiden
saw Loki standing near.</p>

<p>“I have come for the refreshing gift of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of your apples, Iduna,” said he. “A long
journey has wearied my limbs and broken my
spirit.”</p>

<p>“You are very welcome to one of them,”
said Iduna, opening her box. “It has been
some time since you tasted a golden apple.”</p>

<p>Loki began to eat the precious gift, and
Iduna watched him closely. She was very
proud of her refreshing fruit.</p>

<p>In a little while he put the half-eaten apple
on the basin of the fountain and said, “I am
going to tell you a secret, Iduna. Not far
away from here I discovered a grove where a
marvellous tree grows. It bears fruit shaped
like yours but larger and of a deep golden
colour.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” laughed the Spring-Maiden, “the
fruit may be larger and more beautiful than
mine, but I’m sure it has not the power to
put youth and life into those who partake of
it.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are mistaken,” said the
wily Loki. “People who have eaten the fruit
of this tree say that its refreshing power is
wonderful. If you wish, I will gladly guide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
you to the grove—it is not far away—and then
you can compare this fruit, which is attracting
much attention, with yours. Will you
go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will indeed,” said Iduna, who could
not believe that any other apples were comparable
with hers.</p>

<p>Loki led the way and Iduna, carrying her
treasure, followed him eagerly. She was a
little surprised to find the grove Loki described
so far away from Asgard, but her desire
to find fruit more wonderful than the
magic apples urged her on. Finally they
reached a meadow bordered by a dense forest.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Loki, pointing forward, “we
shall soon reach the place.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a dark shadow fell across Iduna’s
path. The Storm Giant, disguised in eagle’s
plumage, swooped down, caught the Spring-Maiden
and her golden apples in his talons,
and sped away to the frozen North. There
the Frost Giants imprisoned the captive in one
of their ice-palaces.</p>

<p>It was not long before the joyous valley of
Spring felt the absence of Iduna. The flowers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
drooped and faded; the grass became parched
and brown, and the tender green foliage
turned to burnt orange, crimson, and russet.</p>

<p>“What has become of Iduna?” cried the
people. “See how the valley is changing!”</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the Frost Giants were
working their way toward the valley of
Spring. One night Hoar-Frost stalked along
the outskirts of the groves and withered the
leaves and flowers with his icy breath. The
next morning the people heard the dismal
howl of North-Wind. “We must find the
Spring-Maiden or we shall die,” they cried in
alarm.</p>

<p>In their distress they begged Odin, the wise
hero who governed Asgard, to call a special
council in order to determine how the secret
of Iduna’s disappearance could be discovered.</p>

<p>Odin called together his hero council and
after earnest thought they decided to question
Loki, the Prince of Mischief. He had seldom
been seen in Asgard since the Spring-Maiden
had left the valley. One of the heroes declared
that the last time he saw Iduna she was
walking with Loki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>The Prince of Mischief was accordingly
summoned to appear in the council of heroes.
His answers to the questions they asked him
aroused suspicion.</p>

<p>“Tell us the truth about this matter,” said
the hero Thor, in a voice which shook like the
roar of distant thunder.</p>

<p>Then the cowardly Loki confessed the plot
which robbed the valley of the Spring-Maiden
and her magic apples.</p>

<p>“Loki,” said Odin sternly, “I command you
to bring back Iduna. Let there be no delay,
for even the heroes of Asgard are suffering
in her absence!”</p>

<p>Loki knew he dared not disobey this final
command. He disguised himself in falcon’s
plumage and sped away to the desolate North
where a dull leaden sky overhung all the land.
In circling about the icebergs he spied the
Storm-Giant, fishing from the top of a large
rock. Loki descended quickly, flew into one
of the openings of the Giant’s ice-palace, and
made his way to the place where Iduna lay
sleeping on a rough couch. The Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Mischief stepped out of his disguise and
awakened the Spring-Maiden.</p>

<p>“False Loki,” she cried. “Have you come
to do more mischief?”</p>

<p>“I have been sent by Odin to rescue you,”
said he. “You can escape only by the help
of my magic.”</p>

<p>Then he transformed Iduna and the precious
casket of apples, placed them in a magic
nutshell, put on his falcon plumage, and flew
away toward Asgard.</p>

<p>As he sped across the dull sky the Storm-Giant
looked up and saw him.</p>

<p>“It is Loki disguised as a falcon,” he said.
“He is taking the Spring-Maiden back to Asgard.
But he shall not escape me!” Instantly
the Storm-Giant put on his eagle plumage
and flew after Loki.</p>

<p>How anxiously the people of Asgard
watched for the return of Loki with Iduna.
They heaped great piles of chips around the
walls of Asgard and held torches ready to light
the fires in case the Frost Giants came near.</p>

<p>On the third day after Loki’s departure
from Asgard, the people saw two great birds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
flying with lightning speed toward the city.</p>

<p>“It is the Storm Giant following Loki,”
they cried. “What a furious pursuit! See!
See! The eagle is gaining on the falcon!
Light the fires as soon as Loki passes over!
Ready! The fires!” Another moment of
breathless suspense! The falcon swept over
the walls of Asgard. Instantly a blaze burst
forth all around the city. The falcon had won
the mighty race. The eagle whirled far
above the flames and looked down into the
city. He dared not descend. With a cry of
despair he sped back to the ice-bound Northland.</p>

<p>“The joyous Spring-Maiden is ours again,”
cried the happy people as they gathered
around Iduna. “Her presence fills us with
life and hope. See, the casket of golden apples
is safe in her hands! Soon all nature will
be fair and beautiful. The Spring-Maiden is
our joy.”</p>

<p>Query Queer was the boy who loved the
woods and asked so many questions. The
Wise-and-Wonder-Man was the spirit of the
woods whom Query met one day and who
answered Query’s questions. Of course, as
Query often went to the woods it was quite
certain that he should sometime meet the
spirit again. And so he did. It happened
one day just as the snow was disappearing and
the sun was growing warm. Query had been
taking his first spring walk, and, as he was a
bit tired, he sat down on the sunny slope of a
knoll. He was scarcely seated when down
out of the green boughs of a hemlock tree in
front of him slid the Wise-and-Wonder-Man,
dressed in his light blue suit with every button
a silver bell, and his pointed cap to match,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>with its fringe of silver bells. At every move
he made, the bells went <i>tinkle-tankle, tinkle-tankle</i>.
Query was so surprised that he almost
forgot to breathe.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Query,” said the Wise-and-Wonder-Man,
“what are you wondering
about now?”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering,” said Query, nodding
his head toward a bluebird near by, “why
the bluebird is the first bird of spring.”</p>

<p>“Why, he is the herald, you know.”</p>

<p>“But how did he come to be the herald?
Do you know?”</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said the Wise-and-Wonder-Man.</p>

<p>“Who told you?”</p>

<p>“My grandmother. She said her grandmother’s
grandmother’s grandmother told the
story; and what her grandmother’s grandmother’s
grandmother said, my grandmother
says is so.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Query. “Would you tell
me the story?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; make yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p>Query lay down on one elbow and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Wise-and-Wonder-Man sat on a fresh, clean chip,
that the choppers had made, and talked.</p>

<p>“You know there are four spirits of the
year, Springtime, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
Some folks call them seasons, but they
are <i>really</i> spirits. Of all four spirits, Springtime
is the favourite. He had been coming to
the earth every year for a great many years,
year after year, when he got it into his head
that it would be a fine thing and quite becoming
to his dignity to have a herald,—some
one to carry his colours and play the fife. At
first he thought of the fragrant flowers, they
could bear his colours. But he reflected that
they could not play the fife. Then he thought
of the buzzing bee; he might be taught to play
the fife. But he remembered that he would
not do, because he could not carry the colours.
So he decided that he must have a bird.</p>

<p>“Springtime, being a very lively and practical
spirit, called the birds together that very
morning. He asked them all to meet him by
the Great Rock under the Great Tree by the
Great Bend of the Big River. They all came—birds
of every size and colour and description.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
He sat on the Great Rock while the
birds sat on the grass and listened with wide,
round, blinking eyes and with heads cocked
to one side.</p>

<p>“He made a speech to them of some length.
He told them that he desired a herald to carry
his colours and to play the fife. Of course,
the bird to be chosen should be handsome and
musical. But he must be more than all that.
He wanted a bird of exceptionally good character,
in fact, the very best bird that could be
found. He did not expect to find a perfect
bird, he said, but he desired a bird as nearly
perfect as he could obtain. He concluded
his speech by saying that his herald should be:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Both handsome and happy, gifted and good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as modest as modest can be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The very best bird that flies in the wood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would that my herald be he.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The choice, he said, he would leave to the
birds as they knew each other thoroughly.</p>

<p>“The birds put their heads together and
talked in at least forty different languages.
Finally, their spokesman told Springtime that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
they were content to leave the selection to a
committee of six whom he might name. As
Springtime wanted to be on good terms with
all the birds, he thought it not best that he
should appoint the committee. He pulled a
handful of grass and held it tightly between
his hands just so that the ends would stick out,
and then he asked the birds to come up, one by
one, and pull out a blade. The six who should
draw out the shortest blades of grass were to
be the committee.</p>

<p>“They walked up one by one, and drew.
Mr. Crow drew the shortest blade and so was
the chairman. Mr. Parrot came next, then Mr.
Blue Jay, Mr. Robin, Mr. English Sparrow,
and Mr. Bluebird. It was a strange committee,
to be sure, of all sizes and kinds of birds.</p>

<p>“That very evening the six birds met in a
corner of Mr. Farmer’s orchard upon a dead
branch of an old apple tree. They talked and
talked and talked. They discussed all the
birds that they knew, spoke of their good
qualities and their bad ones.</p>

<p>“At last, as it grew late, very late, almost
eight o’clock, and they had come to no conclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Mr. Bluebird proposed that they should
vote, and all agreed. But how should they
vote? That was the next question. Mr.
Bluebird suggested that each one, as his name
was called, should stand up and say which bird
he thought was best fitted to be the herald.
Mr. Crow cleared his throat and said that he
did not think this was the wisest way. He
thought it better, he continued, that each one
should write the name of his choice on the
under side of a leaf. The other members of
the committee agreed with Mr. Crow. Each
bird, therefore, took a leaf, and wrote a name
upon it, and Mr. Bluebird counted the votes.
There was one vote for Mr. Crow, one vote for
Mr. Parrot, one for Mr. Blue Jay, one for Mr.
Robin, one for Mr. English Sparrow, and
one for—I don’t remember whether it was for
Mr. Song Sparrow or Mr. Bobolink. Would
you believe it?—every bird except the bluebird
had voted for himself. The bluebird
knew, because he knew the foot-writing of all
the birds. He had seen it in the soft sand by
the water.</p>

<p>“It was certain that they were not going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
be able to decide among themselves who should
be chosen, so Mr. Bluebird made another suggestion.</p>

<p>“‘I recommend,’ he said, ‘that we go and
consult the old Wizard, Mr. Owl, who holds
court every night by the light of the moon in
the hollow of a great grey tree over the ridge.
He is the wisest of birds and knows everything.
I have heard, too, that whenever there
is a star with a tail in the sky he can read your
fortunes and your character. Now it so happens
that at this very time there is in the sky
a star with a tail, for I saw it this morning.
Little Bluey, my eldest child, woke up very
early and I had to fly out to get him a worm to
keep him quiet. Just as I was starting, long
before sunrise, I saw the comet. I propose
that we go at once and consult the Wizard and
let him decide for us who should be the herald.’</p>

<p>“‘It seems to me,’ said the crow, ‘that this
is a most excellent suggestion. The Wizard
is certainly a very wise bird. I have heard
of him and doubtless he has heard of me. By
all means, let us go.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“It was decided then and there that they
should go that very night, just as soon as the
comet rose. Mr. Bluebird was to give the
signal because he knew where to look for the
comet.</p>

<p>“At the proper moment Mr. Bluebird shook
them all by the wing and woke them up, and
they started, Mr. Crow going first, then Mr.
Parrot, Mr. Blue Jay, Mr. Robin, Mr. English
Sparrow, and Mr. Bluebird.</p>

<p>“They flew and they flew and they flew, for
it was a long way and a hard way to find, and
not one of the six had ever been out so late
in his life. When they reached the wood they
were obliged to fly very carefully, so that they
should not bump their heads against the trees,
and so that they might be able to read the
signs along the way. At length they spied a
great grey tree, with a dimly lighted window
in it, far up the trunk. Mr. Crow read the
name on the door-plate and announced that
they had reached the right house. There was
no door-bell so Mr. Crow scratched three
times,—scratch, scratch, scratch.</p>

<p>“‘Who-who?’ came from within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“‘Friends,’ said the crow, ‘six friends come
to consult the Wizard.’</p>

<p>“The latch was promptly lifted and the six
birds walked solemnly in and up the stairs.</p>

<p>“They found themselves in a little dark
round room with seats against the sides. Mr.
Owl sat over on one side, his great fluffy coat
turned up at the neck and his fluffy hood
pulled down to meet it. He had his spectacles
on and was reading by the light of his
lamp,—that is, it looked like a lamp, but Mr.
Owl explained later that it was not a lamp
but the comet’s light which he caught through
a knot-hole.</p>

<p>“The Wizard received them pleasantly and
motioned to them to be seated. Mr. Crow
sat down in front of the Wizard at his right,
then the others in order, Mr. Bluebird sitting
at the left.</p>

<p>“‘It is very late,’ observed the owl. ‘It
must be most important business that brings
you to me at this hour of the night.’</p>

<p>“‘It is,’ replied the crow, ‘exceedingly important
business, indeed.’</p>

<p>“Then in plain and emphatic words he told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the Wizard what their errand was. He repeated
as nearly as he could the speech of
Springtime, especially the last words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Both handsome and happy, gifted and good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as modest as modest can be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The very best bird that flies in the wood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would that my herald be he.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“He told the Wizard of their inability to
decide who should be chosen and of their conclusion
to leave the choice to him. This was
the reason of their visit.</p>

<p>“Then the owl looked grave as a judge and
remarked, ‘It seems to me in this situation
that the first thing to be done is to secure the
opinion of each of you as to who is the fittest
bird to be chosen. Mr. Crow, will you be so
good as to give us your opinion?’</p>

<p>“Mr. Crow stood up, cleared his throat, and
said, ‘To speak quite frankly, it seems to me
that I, myself, should be chosen. It is
scarcely possible to find a better bird.’</p>

<p>“‘What makes you think so?’ asked the owl
dryly.</p>

<p>“‘My wife,’ said the crow. ‘Only to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Mrs. Crow said to me, “Mr. Crow, my dear
husband, you are a perfect man, unless—”’</p>

<p>“‘Unless what?’ inquired the Wizard, raising
his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t recollect,’ replied the crow, ‘in
fact, I didn’t hear distinctly, but I am sure
it was something unimportant,’ and he sat
down.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Parrot,’ said the Wizard, ‘your opinion,
if you please.’</p>

<p>“‘It is my opinion,’ said Mr. Parrot, ‘that
I am the bird who should be chosen. I have
heard myself talk on many an occasion, and
I am sure that I speak both wisdom and wit.
In modesty, I forbear to say more.’</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Blue Jay!’ called the Wizard.</p>

<p>“‘Since you ask me, Mr. Wizard, for my
honest opinion I am bound to say that I feel
that I am the only bird for this position. I
have been looking in the glass to-day; in fact,
I see myself in the glass very often, and I have
never yet observed a single fault in myself.
There is no bird who can say more.’</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Robin, if you please.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Robin arose with his fingers in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
armholes: ‘I am quite convinced, Mr. Wizard,
from much observation, that I should be
made the herald. I am handsome and gifted,
if I do say it myself. Besides, I live in the best
of society; I dwell in the Bishop’s orchard.
This very day I heard the Bishop say, “That
robin is a fine, handsome bird,—as fine and
handsome as a Bishop.” I am sure that
recommendation is enough.’</p>

<p>“‘Mr. English Sparrow.’</p>

<p>“‘I am sure, Mr. Wizard,’ said the sparrow,
speaking very rapidly and excitedly, ‘that
while I am not so big as some of these who
have spoken, I have a better claim than any
of them to this high office. For I have long
made it a practice to study carefully the faults
and weaknesses of all the other birds, and I
know that I have none of these failings.’</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Bluebird,’ said the Wizard, ‘what
have you to say?’</p>

<p>“‘Nothing, Mr. Wizard. I have not made
up my mind. I leave the matter entirely to
your eminent wisdom and judgment.’ And
he sat down.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the owl, after a moment’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
deliberation, ‘the next thing to do under these
circumstances seems to be to read your fortunes,
that is, your characters, in the light of
the comet. I shall ask you, one by one, to
step up on this judgment-seat at my left, where
the light of the comet can fall on you and
where I can see you plainly. Mr. Crow, will
you be the first?’</p>

<p>“Mr. Crow stepped up to the judgment-seat
very confidently, while the Wizard put on his
spectacles and turned the lamp so that the light
fell full upon the glossy feathers of the large
black bird. It was a revolving seat, which
the Wizard turned round and round slowly so
that he could see all sides of the bird. ‘A
fine bird,’ he said, very deliberately, as if
thinking aloud, ‘a perfect bird, unless—unless
what?—let me see—ah, a slant in the left
eye—in <i>both</i> eyes—a <i>very decided</i> slant—very
sly—very cunning—inclined to steal—very
<i>much</i> inclined to steal—a thief, in fact; steals
Mr. Farmer’s corn and peas—especially in
the early morning when nobody is around—a
<i>very bad</i> fault—one of the worst. I am quite
sure, Mr. Crow, that Springtime would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
choose you for his herald—he could not trust
you. That will do. Mr. Parrot!’</p>

<p>“Mr. Parrot walked up very sedately and
took his place on the judgment-seat. The
Wizard gazed at him gravely and stroked his
back. ‘Fine feathers—green, red—yellow—fine
feathers—rather small head—large tongue—large
tongue, small head—talks more than
he thinks—talks <i>very much</i> more than he
thinks—talks often <i>without</i> thinking—says
what he hears others say. Tongue rather
harsh, too—and blisters at the end—bad
words! bad words! I am sorry to say, Mr.
Parrot, that I cannot recommend you as herald.
People would not be glad to see you
year after year. That will do. Mr. Blue
Jay!’</p>

<p>“The blue jay stepped up very jauntily and
took the seat.</p>

<p>“The Wizard looked at him admiringly, for
he was clad in a beautiful tailor-made suit that
fitted him to perfection. ‘A handsome bird,’
he said, ‘a handsome bird,—that is, handsome
clothes. Eye very good, too—a little slant, a
little slant—but on the whole a good eye. Let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
me see, what is this on the back of the head?
these long feathers?—oh, a crest! I see.
Just for decoration. A vain bird, vain as a
peacock—and like all vain people, hard to get
along with—and very unfriendly—likes to
flock alone—other folks not quite good
enough. I regret to inform you, Mr. Blue
Jay, that Springtime would not desire you as
his herald. That will do. Mr. Robin!’</p>

<p>“The robin hopped up on the seat in his fine
dress suit and red shirt-front, his chest inflated
and his eyes shining. The Wizard looked at
him intently for some time, then he began,
‘You are the Bishop’s friend, you say. Let
me see—a bright red spot on your bill—the
Bishop’s cherries, I should say—but we’ll let
that pass. Eye very suspicious—<i>very</i> suspicious—always
looking even among your best
friends, to see if somebody isn’t going to harm
you—cannot pull a worm out of the Bishop’s
garden without looking around suspiciously
all the time. A very unhappy frame of mind
to be in—unhappy for you—unhappy for
others. You would hardly do for the herald.
That will do. Mr. English Sparrow!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“The English sparrow fluttered up noisily
and took his place. ‘You say,’ began the
Wizard, ‘that you have not the faults of the
other birds.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the sparrow, talking very fast,
‘I am not as mean as the crow, and I don’t
talk such nonsense as old Polly, and I’m not
so stuck up as the jay, and I am not suspicious
as the Bishop’s friend is. I haven’t any of
the faults of the other birds.’</p>

<p>“The Wizard pushed his spectacles up on
his brow, turned the light away, and looked
at him, ‘I see,’ he said, ‘I do not need the
comet light at all. I could see you in the
dark. Sharp bill—sharp tongue—sharp
claws, in a continual state of bad temper—very
quarrelsome—very unpleasant neighbour;
in fact, a common nuisance. That will
do, Mr. Bluebird!’</p>

<p>“‘I am sure, Mr. Owl,’ said the bluebird,
rising, ‘that I need not take your time. I am
not the bird to be chosen, for I know that I
am far from being a perfect bird. I have
many faults. There are many nobler birds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
than I from whom Springtime may choose his
herald.’</p>

<p>“But the Wizard was quite insistent that the
bluebird should come forward where he could
read his fortune.</p>

<p>“‘You say that you have many faults,’ remarked
the Owl. ‘That may be, but I see
by the light of the comet that they are small,
very faint indeed. Besides, the ability to see
one’s faults and the desire to correct them is
the greatest of virtues. There may be better
birds, but I am frank to say that I am not acquainted
with them. I have no hesitation,
Mr. Bluebird, in saying that it is my judgment
that you should be the herald of the Spring,
for, if you will permit me to say it, it seems
that you are</p>

<p class="noindent">whereat Mr. Bluebird blushed painfully,
while in his heart he was very happy.</p>

<p>A child once said to his grandsire:
“Gran’pa, what do the flowers mean when
they talk to the old oak-tree about death? I
hear them talking every day, but I cannot
understand; it is all very strange.”</p>

<p>The grandsire bade the child think no more
of these things; the flowers were foolish prattlers,—what
right had they to put such notions
into a child’s head? But the child did not do
his grandsire’s bidding; he loved the flowers
and the trees, and he went each day to hear
them talk.</p>

<p>It seems that the little vine down by the
stone wall had overheard the South Wind say
to the rosebush: “You are a proud, imperious
beauty now, and will not listen to my suit;
but wait till my boisterous brother comes from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>the North,—then you will droop and wither
and die, all because you would not listen to
me and fly with me to my home by the Southern
sea.”</p>

<p>These words set the little vine to thinking;
and when she had thought for a long time she
spoke to the daisy about it, and the daisy called
in the violet, and the three little ones had a
very serious conference; but, having talked it
all over, they came to the conclusion that it
was as much of a mystery as ever. The old
oak-tree saw them.</p>

<p>“You little folks seem very much puzzled
about something,” said the oak-tree.</p>

<p>“I heard the South Wind tell the rosebush
that she would die,” exclaimed the vine, “and
we do not understand what it is. Can you tell
us what it is to die?”</p>

<p>The old oak-tree smiled sadly.</p>

<p>“I do not call it death,” said the old oak-tree;
“I call it sleep,—a long, restful, refreshing
sleep.”</p>

<p>“How does it feel,” inquired the daisy,
looking very full of astonishment and anxiety.</p>

<p>“You must know,” said the oak-tree, “that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
after many, many days we all have had such
merry times and have bloomed so long and
drunk so heartily of the dew and sunshine and
eaten so much of the goodness of the earth
that we feel very weary and we long for repose.
Then a great wind comes out of the
North, and we shiver in its icy blast. The
sunshine goes away, and there is no dew for us
nor any nourishment in the earth, and we are
glad to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Mercy on me!” cried the vine, “I shall not
like that at all! What, leave this smiling
meadow and all the pleasant grass and singing
bees and frolicsome butterflies? No, old
oak-tree, I would never go to sleep; I much
prefer sporting with the winds and playing
with my little friends, the daisy and the
violet.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said the violet, “I think it would
be dreadful to go to sleep. What if we never
should wake up again!”</p>

<p>The suggestion struck the others dumb with
terror,—all but the oak-tree.</p>

<p>“Have no fear of that,” said the old oak-tree,
“for you are sure to awaken again, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
when you have awakened the new life will be
sweeter and happier than the old.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” cried the thistle. “You
children shouldn’t believe a word of it.
When you go to sleep you die, and when you
die there’s the last of you!”</p>

<p>The old oak-tree reproved the thistle; but
the thistle maintained his abominable heresy
so stoutly that the little vine and the daisy
and the violet were quite at a loss to know
which of the two to believe,—the old oak-tree
or the thistle.</p>

<p>The child heard it all and was sorely
puzzled. What was this death, this mysterious
sleep? Would it come upon him, the
child? And after he had slept awhile would
he awaken? His grandsire would not tell
him of these things; perhaps his grandsire did
not know.</p>

<p>It was a long, long summer, full of sunshine
and bird-music, and the meadow was like a
garden, and the old oak-tree looked down upon
the grass and flowers and saw that no evil
befell them. A long, long play-day it was to
the little vine, the daisy, and the violet. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
crickets and the grasshoppers and the bumblebees
joined in the sport, and romped and made
music till it seemed like an endless carnival.
Only every now and then the vine and her
little flower friends talked with the old oak-tree
about that strange sleep and the promised
awakening, and the thistle scoffed at the old
oak-tree’s cheering words. The child was
there and heard it all.</p>

<p>One day the great wind came out of the
North. Hurry-scurry! back to their warm
homes in the earth and under the old stone-wall
scampered the crickets and bumblebees
to go to sleep. Whirr, whirr! Oh, but how
piercing the great wind was; how different
from his amiable brother who had travelled
all the way from the Southern sea to kiss the
flowers and woo the rose!</p>

<p>“Well, this is the last of us!” exclaimed the
thistle; “we’re going to die, and that’s the end
of it all!”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried the old oak-tree; “we shall
not die; we are going to sleep. Here, take
my leaves, little flowers, and you shall sleep
warm under them. Then, when you awaken,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
you shall see how much sweeter and happier
the new life is.”</p>

<p>The little ones were very weary indeed.
The promised sleep came very gratefully.</p>

<p>“We would not be so willing to go to sleep
if we thought we should not awaken,” said
the violet.</p>

<p>So the little ones went to sleep. The little
vine was the last of all to sink to her slumbers;
she nodded in the wind and tried to keep
awake till she saw the old oak-tree close his
eyes, but her efforts were vain; she nodded and
nodded, and bowed her slender form against
the old stone wall, till finally she, too, had
sunk into repose. And then the old oak-tree
stretched his weary limbs and gave a last look
at the sullen sky and at the slumbering little
ones at his feet; and with that, the old oak-tree
fell asleep too.</p>

<p>The child saw all these things, and he
wanted to ask his grandsire about them, but
his grandsire would not tell him of them;
perhaps his grandsire did not know.</p>

<p>The child saw the Storm King come down
from the hills and ride furiously over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
meadows and over the forest and over the
town. The snow fell everywhere, and the
North Wind played solemn music in the chimneys.
The Storm King put the brook to bed,
and threw a great mantle of snow over him;
and the brook that had romped and prattled
all the summer and told pretty tales to the
grass and flowers,—the brook went to sleep
too. With all his fierceness and bluster, the
Storm King was very kind; he did not awaken
the old oak-tree and the slumbering flowers.
The little vine lay under the fleecy snow
against the old stone-wall and slept peacefully,
and so did the violet and the daisy.
Only the wicked old thistle thrashed about in
his sleep as if he dreamt bad dreams, which,
all will allow, was no more than he deserved.</p>

<p>All through that winter—and it seemed
very long—the child thought of the flowers
and the vine and the old oak-tree, and wondered
whether in the springtime they would
awaken from their sleep; and he wished for
the springtime to come. And at last the
springtime came. One day the sunbeams fluttered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
down from the sky and danced all over
the meadow.</p>

<p>“Wake up, little friends!” cried the sunbeams,—“wake
up, for it is springtime!”</p>

<p>The brook was the first to respond. So
eager, so fresh, so exuberant was he after his
long winter sleep, that he leaped from his
bed and frolicked all over the meadow and
played all sorts of curious antics. Then a
little bluebird was seen in the hedge one
morning. He was calling to the violet.</p>

<p>“Wake up, little violet,” called the bluebird.
“Have I come all this distance to find
you sleeping? Wake up, it is the springtime!”</p>

<p>That pretty little voice awakened the violet.</p>

<p>“Oh, how sweetly I have slept!” cried the
violet; “how happy this new life is! Welcome,
dear friends!”</p>

<p>And presently the daisy awakened, fresh
and beautiful, and then the little vine, and,
last of all, the old oak-tree. The meadow was
green, and all around were the music, the fragrance,
the new, sweet life of the springtime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“I slept horribly,” growled the thistle. “I
had bad dreams. It was sleep, after all, but
it ought to have been death.”</p>

<p>The thistle never complained again; for
just then a four-footed monster stalked
through the meadow and plucked and ate the
thistle and then stalked gloomily away; which
was the last of the sceptical thistle,—truly a
most miserable end!</p>

<p>“You said the truth, dear old oak-tree!”
cried the little vine. “It was not death,—it
was only a sleep, a sweet, refreshing sleep, and
this awakening is very beautiful.”</p>

<p>They all said so,—the daisy, the violet, the
oak-tree, the crickets, the bees, and all the
things and creatures of the field and forest that
had awakened from their long sleep to swell
the beauty and the glory of the springtime.
And they talked with the child, and the child
heard them. And although the grandsire
never spoke to the child about these things,
the child learned from the flowers and trees
a lesson of the springtime which perhaps the
grandsire never knew.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span></p>

</div>

<p>Every afternoon, as they were coming from
school, the children used to go and play in the
Giant’s garden.</p>

<p>It was a large lovely garden, with soft green
grass. Here and there over the grass stood
beautiful flowers like stars, and there were
twelve peach trees that in the spring time
broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and
pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The
birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that
the children used to stop their games in order
to listen to them. “How happy we are here!”
they cried to each other.</p>

<p>One day the Giant came back. He had
been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and
had stayed with him for seven years. After
the seven years were over he had said all that
he had to say, for his conversation was limited,
and he determined to return to his own castle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
When he arrived he saw the children playing
in the garden.</p>

<p>“What are you doing there?” he cried in a
very gruff voice, and the children ran away.</p>

<p>“My own garden is my own garden,” said
the Giant; “any one can understand that, and
I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.”
So he built a high wall all round it, and put
up a notice-board—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/trespassers.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED</p>
</div>

<p>He was a very selfish giant.</p>

<p>The poor children had nowhere to play.
They tried to play on the road, but the road
was very dusty and full of hard stones, and
they did not like it. They used to wander
round the high wall when their lessons were
over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.</p>

<p>“How happy we were there,” they said to
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Then the Spring came, and all over the
country there were little blossoms and little
birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant
it was still winter. The birds did not care to
sing in it, as there were no children, and the
trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful
flower put its head out from the grass, and
when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry
for the children that it slipped back into the
ground again, and went off to sleep. The
only people who were pleased were the Snow
and the Frost. “Spring has forgotten this
garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all
the year around.” The Snow covered up the
grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost
painted all the trees silver. Then they invited
the North Wind to stay with them, and
he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he
roared all day about the garden, and blew the
chimney-pots down. “This is a delightful
spot,” he said; “we must ask the Hail on a
visit.” So the Hail came. Every day for
three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle
till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran
round and round the garden as fast as he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath
was like ice.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand why the Spring is so
late in coming,” said the Selfish Giant, as he
sat at the window and looked out at his cold
white garden; “I hope there will be a change
in the weather.”</p>

<p>But the Spring never came, nor the Summer.
The Autumn gave golden fruit to every
garden, but to the Giant’s garden she gave
none. “He is too selfish,” she said. So it
was always Winter there, and the North
Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the
Snow danced about through the trees.</p>

<p>One morning the Giant was lying awake in
bed when he heard some lovely music. It
sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it
must be the King’s musicians passing by. It
was really only a little linnet singing outside
his window, but it was so long since he had
heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed
to him to be the most beautiful music in the
world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over
his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring,
and a delicious perfume came to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
through the open casement. “I believe the
Spring has come at last,” said the Giant, and
he jumped out of bed and looked out.</p>

<p>What did he see?</p>

<p>He saw a most wonderful sight. Through
a little hole in the wall the children had crept
in, and they were sitting in the branches of
the trees. In every tree that he could see
there was a little child. And the trees were
so glad to have the children back again that
they had covered themselves with blossoms,
and were waving their arms gently above the
children’s heads. The birds were flying about
and twittering with delight, and the flowers
were looking up through the green grass and
laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one
corner it was still winter. It was the farthest
corner of the garden, and in it was standing a
little boy. He was so small that he could
not reach up to the branches of the tree, and
he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.
The poor tree was still quite covered with
frost and snow, and the North Wind was
blowing and roaring above it. “Climb up!
little boy,” said the Tree, and it bent its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
branches down as low as it could; but the boy
was too tiny.</p>

<p>And the Giant’s heart melted as he looked
out. “How selfish I have been!” he said;
“now I know why the Spring would not come
here. I will put that poor little boy on the
top of the tree, and then I will knock down
the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s
playground for ever and ever.” He was
really very sorry for what he had done.</p>

<p>So he crept down-stairs and opened the
front door quite softly, and went out into the
garden. But when the children saw him they
were so frightened that they all ran away, and
the garden became winter again. Only the
little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full
of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.
And the Giant strode up behind him and took
him gently in his hand, and put him up into
the tree. And the tree broke at once into
blossom, and the birds came and sang on it,
and the little boy stretched out his two arms
and flung them round the Giant’s neck, and
kissed him. And the other children, when
they saw that the Giant was not wicked any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
longer, came running back, and with them
came the Spring. “It is your garden now,
little children,” said the Giant, and he took a
great axe and knocked down the wall. And
when the people were going to market at
twelve o’clock they found the Giant playing
with the children in the most beautiful garden
they had ever seen.</p>

<p>All day long they played, and in the evening
they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.</p>

<p>“But where is your little companion?” he
said; “the boy I put into the tree.” The
Giant loved him the best because he had kissed
him.</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” answered the children.
“He has gone away.”</p>

<p>“You must tell him to be sure and come
here to-morrow,” said the Giant. But the children
said that they did not know where he
lived, and had never seen him before; and the
Giant felt very sad.</p>

<p>Every afternoon, when school was over, the
children came and played with the Giant.
But the little boy whom the Giant loved was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
never seen again. The Giant was very kind
to all the children, yet he longed for his first
little friend, and often spoke of him. “How
I would like to see him!” he used to say.</p>

<p>Years went over, and the Giant grew very
old and feeble. He could not play about
any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and
watched the children at their games, and admired
his garden. “I have many beautiful
flowers,” he said; “but the children are the
most beautiful flowers of all.”</p>

<p>One winter morning he looked out of his
window as he was dressing. He did not hate
the Winter now, for he knew that it was
merely Spring asleep, and that the flowers
were resting.</p>

<p>Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and
looked and looked. It certainly was a marvellous
sight. In the farthest corner of the garden
was a tree quite covered with lovely white
blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and
silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath
it stood the little boy he had loved.</p>

<p>Down-stairs ran the Giant in great joy, and
out into the garden. He hastened across, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
came near to the child. And when he came
quite close his face grew red with anger, and
he said, “Who hath dared to wound thee?”
For on the palms of the child’s hands were the
prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails
were on the little feet.</p>

<p>“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the
Giant; “tell me, that I may take my big sword
and slay him.”</p>

<p>“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are
the wounds of Love.”</p>

<p>“Who art thou?” said the Giant, and a
strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before
the little child.</p>

<p>And the child smiled on the Giant, and said
to him, “You let me play once in your garden;
to-day you shall come with me to my garden,
which is Paradise.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Andrea Hofer Proudfoot</span></p>

</div>

<p>There was once a promise made to all the
people of the world, and every one was waiting
and had been waiting long for it to be kept.</p>

<p>No one could remember who had made the
promise, but the little children were told that
it was made by a great King who knew everything
that had ever happened, and all things
that would ever be.</p>

<p>And this was the promise:</p>

<p>A wonderful flower was to grow in a certain
garden that would bring to the one who owned
the garden all the good things in the world.</p>

<p>Every one waited and waited for the flower
to come. Years and years they had waited—summer
after summer; each new little boy
and girl that came into the world was told
of the great promise, and among the very
first things they did was to go about seeking
the flower and asking questions about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>But no one could tell them anything except
to repeat the promise that a beautiful gift-plant
would some day grow upon the earth,
which only people with loving hearts could
see, and they should be greatly blessed.</p>

<p>Every one in the whole world went about
looking for this flower; even though they did
a great deal of work, and thought of other
things, yet they never quite forgot the wonderful
promise.</p>

<p>Many of them prepared the soil and made
beautiful gardens to receive it. Some sought
far and wide for rare seeds and bulbs which
they planted and watered, but only such plants
grew as every one had seen before, and so
they still waited and searched.</p>

<p>Many others wished and wished, and some
prayed and prayed, but the precious seed did
not come.</p>

<p>The rich men of the land had great parks
laid out; the ground was tilled and everything
kept ready for the plant to find root.
Many gardeners and watchers were hired to
stay there and watch for this wondrous flower
and guard it—but it did not come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>Yet no one ever doubted the promise, for
every one wished very much to have all the
good things which were to come with this
flower.</p>

<p>Among all these people there was one very
kind woman, who did many good deeds. She
loved and cared for little children who had
no one to help them. One night when she
came home from her work what did she see
in a little broken flower-pot that stood in her
window?</p>

<p>A tiny plant which she had never noticed
before! She watered it and it grew and
grew, and she learned to love it.</p>

<p>One day while she was looking at the tiny
plant she remembered the promise, and said
quietly to herself: “Can it be that this is the
beautiful flower the whole world is waiting
for! I think it is, for it has made me so
happy.”</p>

<p>And it was the flower.</p>

<p>She knew the promise had come because it
made her so happy.</p>

<p>Every one, far and near, came to see it;
and they begged pieces and seeds to plant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
And though the good woman gave of her
plant, it grew larger and larger, and she became
happier and happier.</p>

<p>One day it blossomed wide and beautiful.</p>

<p>The rich men who had made great parks
and gardens for the flower would not believe
the woman had received the real promised
plant. They shook their heads and laughed
at it all, and went on seeking after other seeds
and plants.</p>

<p>But the people who believed because they
saw how happy it made the woman to whom
the flower came, brought rich gifts to her and
begged for the seed, and they took it home and
planted it everywhere, that the whole world
might be filled with joy and peace.</p>

</div>

<p>A long time ago there lived a king and a
queen, who said every day, “If only we had
a child”; but for a long time they had none.</p>

<p>It fell out once, as the Queen was bathing,
that a frog crept out of the water on to the
land and said to her: “Your wish shall be
fulfilled; before a year has passed you shall
bring a daughter into the world.”</p>

<p>The frog’s words came true. The Queen
had a little girl who was so beautiful that
the King could not contain himself for joy,
and prepared a great feast. He invited not
only his relations, friends and acquaintances,
but the fairies, in order that they might be
favourably and kindly disposed toward the
child. There were thirteen of them in the
kingdom, but as the King had only twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
golden plates for them to eat off, one of the
fairies had to stay at home.</p>

<p>The feast was held with all splendour, and
when it came to an end the fairies all presented
the child with magic gifts. One gave her
virtue, another beauty, a third riches, and so
on, with everything in the world that she could
wish for.</p>

<p>When eleven of the fairies had said their
say, the thirteenth suddenly appeared. She
wanted to revenge herself for not having been
invited. Without greeting any one, or even
glancing at the company, she called out in a
loud voice, “The Princess shall prick herself
with a distaff in her fifteenth year and shall
fall dead”; and without another word she
turned and left the hall.</p>

<p>Every one was terror-stricken, but the
twelfth fairy, whose wish was still unspoken,
stepped forward. She could not cancel the
curse, but could only soften it, so she said:
“It shall not be death, but a deep sleep lasting
a hundred years, into which your daughter
shall fall.”</p>

<p>The King was so anxious to guard his dear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
child from the misfortune that he sent out a
command that all the distaffs in the whole
kingdom should be burned.</p>

<p>All the promises of the fairies came true.</p>

<p>The Princess grew up so beautiful, modest,
kind, and clever that every one who saw her
could not but love her. Now it happened that
on the very day when she was fifteen years
old the King and Queen were away from
home, and the Princess was left alone in the
castle. She wandered about over the whole
place, looking at rooms and halls as she
pleased, and at last she came to an old tower.
She ascended a narrow winding staircase and
reached a little door. A rusty key was sticking
in the lock, and when she turned it the door
flew open. In a little room sat an old woman
with a spindle busily spinning her flax.</p>

<p>“Good day, Granny,” said the Princess;
“what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I am spinning,” said the old woman, and
nodded her head. “What is the thing that
whirls round so merrily?” asked the Princess;
and she took the spindle and tried to spin too.</p>

<p>But she had scarcely touched it before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
curse was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger
with the spindle. The instant she felt the
prick she fell upon the bed which was standing
near, and lay still in a deep sleep which
spread over the whole castle.</p>

<p>The King and Queen, who had just come
home and had stepped into the hall, went to
sleep, and all their courtiers with them. The
horses went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in
the yard, the doves on the roof, the flies on
the wall; yes, even the fire flickering on the
hearth grew still and went to sleep, and the
roast meat stopped crackling; and the cook,
who was pulling the scullion’s hair because
he had made some mistake, let him go and
went to sleep. And the wind dropped, and
on the trees in front of the castle not a leaf
stirred.</p>

<p>But round the castle a hedge of brier roses
began to grow up; every year it grew higher,
till at last it surrounded the whole castle so
that nothing could be seen of it, not even the
flags on the roof.</p>

<p>But there was a legend in the land about the
lovely sleeping Brier Rose, as the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
daughter was called, and from time to time
princes came and tried to force a way through
the hedge into the castle. But they found it
impossible, for the thorns, as though they had
hands, held them fast, and the princes remained
caught in them without being able
to free themselves.</p>

<p>After many, many years a prince came again
to the country and heard an old man tell of
the castle which stood behind the brier hedge,
in which a most beautiful maiden called Brier
Rose had been asleep for the last hundred
years, and with her slept the King, Queen, and
all her courtiers. He knew also, from his
grandfather, that many princes had already
come and sought to pierce through the brier
hedge, and had remained caught in it and died
a sad death.</p>

<p>Then the young Prince said: “I am not
afraid; I am determined to go and look upon
the lovely Brier Rose.”</p>

<p>The good old man did all in his power to
dissuade him, but the Prince would not listen
to his words.</p>

<p>Now, however, the hundred years were just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
ended, and the day had come when Brier Rose
was to wake up again. When the Prince approached
the brier hedge it was in blossom,
and was covered with beautiful large flowers
which made way for him of their own accord
and let him pass unharmed, and then closed
up again into a hedge behind him.</p>

<p>In the courtyard he saw the horses and
dappled hounds lying asleep, on the roof sat
the doves with their heads under their wings,
and when he went into the house the flies were
asleep on the walls, and near the throne lay
the King and Queen; in the kitchen was
the cook, with his hand raised as though
about to strike the scullion, and the maid sat
with the black fowl before her which she was
about to pluck.</p>

<p>He went on farther, and all was so still that
he could hear his own breathing. At last he
reached the tower, and opened the door into
the little room where Brier Rose was asleep.
There she lay, looking so beautiful that he
could not take his eyes off her; he bent down
and gave her a kiss. As he touched her, Brier
Rose opened her eyes and looked quite sweetly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
at him. Then they went down together; and
the King and Queen and all the courtiers
woke up, and looked at each other with astonished
eyes. The horses in the stable stood
up and shook themselves, the hounds leaped
about and wagged their tails, the doves on the
roof lifted their heads from under their wings,
looked around and flew into the fields; the
flies on the walls began to crawl again, the fire
in the kitchen roused itself and blazed up and
cooked the food, the meat began to crackle,
and the cook boxed the scullion’s ears so
soundly that he screamed aloud, while the
maid finished plucking the fowl. Then the
wedding of the Prince and Brier Rose was
celebrated with all splendour, and they lived
happily till they died.</p>

<p>Many years ago a good man, who lived in
France, was thrown into prison because the
King suspected him of having plotted against
the government.</p>

<p>Within four grey stone walls, with only one
small window through which the little stream
of sunshine came, the poor man was kept captive
for months and years. He was not allowed
to speak to a living soul except his jailer
who at best was but a cross old fellow. He
had no work to do. There were no books to
read, and his only source of amusement during
many long tedious hours was drawing pictures
with a bit of charcoal on the bare stone walls
of his prison cell.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the poor captive was
permitted to leave his cell for one hour each
morning and go up a narrow winding stairway
which led him into a small courtyard on all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
sides of which rose high, strong prison walls.
There was no roof overhead. Here the prisoner
could breathe the fresh air and feel the
warm sun and by looking up he could see a
bit of the blue sky above.</p>

<p>Day after day the prison life went on in the
same round without any change or hope of
change. The bitterness and loneliness of the
poor man’s lot grew upon him as months and
years passed without a word from his family
or friends and without hope of ever seeing one
of them again. And by and by a time came
when he could no longer even find amusement
in sketching upon the walls of his cell,
for not one vacant spot was left in all that
space where he could draw a picture. He
was a very unhappy man indeed, and it is hard
to say how it might have ended. But one
day a new interest came into his life—an interest
which changed the poor fellow from an
unhappy bitter man who had come to hate
everybody and everything, into one who forgot
all wrong and who learned to see only the good
and the beautiful in all around him. And this
interest came about through the growing up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
of a tiny stray seed which had been blown into
the courtyard by the wind and had taken root
between two of the great stones with which
the courtyard was paved.</p>

<p>It happened that one day as the prisoner was
taking his daily walk his eyes caught sight of
the bright green of the little seedling just in
time to save it from being crushed beneath his
foot. He stopped and looked closer. Then
he saw how a little plant had sent down its
rootlets into the crevice between the stones and
had struggled to push its head up where its
green leaves might catch what they could of
the scant sunshine. He thought how wonderful
it was that the little seed had found
courage to take root and struggle for life in
the dark and gloomy courtyard of the prison.
“Brave little plant,” he said. “You deserve
to live. I shall watch over you and guard
you, for the wind and the hail are hard enemies.”</p>

<p>Day by day he noticed how bravely it grew
higher and higher and unfolded one leaf
after another to the dull sunshine. He became
more and more interested in the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
nursling which in time was like a dear friend
and companion to him. He called it Picciola,
which means, “little one,” and before many
days had passed, it had taken root and grown
in his own heart so that there was no longer
room for bitterness or memory of any wrongs.</p>

<p>At one time when a great hailstorm sent its
cruel hail into the courtyard, the prisoner bent
over Picciola to protect it and the driving
hailstones fell upon his own head until the
storm was over.</p>

<p>“My poor little Picciola,” he said, “I shall
not always be here to guard you from harm.
Much can happen to my little plant when
I am in my cell. I will build a little fence
around you, then the wind cannot blow you
down nor the hail cut you with sharp stones.”</p>

<p>The cross jailer, too, took an interest in
Picciola when he saw how happy the prisoner
had become and he was glad to help take care
of the little plant. Somehow, the jailer did
not seem to be such a cross fellow as before;
indeed he seemed to be quite a gentle and kind
hearted man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>Now the prisoner was very happy and the
days were no longer weary and without interest
for Picciola was always waiting for him in
the courtyard and he was sure to see something
new about the little plant each morning he
visited it. And Picciola grew and grew and
in time put forth two beautiful blossoms and
sent perfume to make glad the heart of her
friend.</p>

<p>But one morning alas! when the prisoner
went to look at Picciola he found that, in spite
of all his care, she had begun to droop and
wither. What could be the matter? In a
moment he was on the ground examining the
little plant to find out what was causing all
the trouble. He soon discovered that Picciola
had grown so large that there was no longer
room enough for it to grow in the crevice
between the stones. The sharp edges of the
stones cut into the delicate stem and the poor
prisoner could see that his little companion
would die unless the stones could be lifted.</p>

<p>He was in great distress. He tried with all
the strength he had to lift the stones himself;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
but he could not move them. He begged the
jailer to help him.</p>

<p>“I can do nothing for you,” said the jailer.
“You must ask the King; he alone has the
power to say that the stones should be lifted.”</p>

<p>“But the King is far away,” said the prisoner.
“There is but one way to reach him—I
must write.”</p>

<p>The poor fellow in despair sent a letter to
the King begging him to save the life of his
little friend, Picciola. The letter was written
on a white handkerchief with a bit of charcoal.
He begged the King, not for his own freedom
and life, but for the life of Picciola. As soon
as the King finished reading the prisoner’s
letter he said:</p>

<p>“This man is not really wicked at heart or
he could not care so much for a little plant.
The stones shall be raised that the little plant
may live, and I will pardon this prisoner
because of his great love and sacrifice for so
helpless a thing as Picciola.” So the prisoner
was released and when he left his lonely prison
cell he took Picciola with him, for she had
been the beginning for him of a new happiness.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">William Canton</span></p>

</div>

<p>To all living things on earth and air and water
St. Francis was most gracious and loving.
They were all his little brothers and sisters,
and he forgot them not, still less scorned or
slighted them, but spoke to them often and
blessed them, and in return they showed him
great love and sought to be of his fellowship.
He bade his companions keep plots of ground
for their little sisters the flowers, and to these
lovely and speechless creatures he spoke, with
no great fear that they would not understand
his words. And all this was a marvellous
thing in a cruel time, when human life was
accounted of slight worth by fierce barons and
ruffling marauders.</p>

<p>For the bees he set honey and wine in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
winter, lest they should feel the nip of the cold
too keenly; and bread for the birds, that they
all, but especially “my brother Lark,” should
have joy of Christmastide; and when a youth
gave St. Francis the turtle-doves he had
snared, the Saint had nests made for them, and
there they laid their eggs and hatched them,
and fed from the hands of the brethren.</p>

<p>Out of affection a fisherman once gave him
a great tench, but he put it back into the clear
water of the lake, bidding it love God; and the
fish played about the boat till St. Francis
blessed it and bade it go.</p>

<p>“Why dost thou torment my little brothers
the Lambs,” he asked of a shepherd, “carrying
them bound thus and hanging from a staff,
so that they cry piteously?” And in exchange
for the lambs he gave the shepherd his cloak.
And at another time seeing amid a flock of
goats one white lamb feeding, he was concerned
that he had nothing but his brown robe
to offer for it; but a merchant came up and
paid for it and gave it him, and he took it with
him to the city and preached about it so that
the hearts of those hearing him were melted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Fain would I tell of the coneys that took
refuge in the folds of his habit, and of the
swifts which flew screaming in their glee while
he was preaching; but now it is time to speak
of the sermon which he preached to a great
multitude of birds in a field by the roadside.
Down from the trees flew the birds to hear
him, and they nestled in the grassy bosom of
the field, and listened till he had done. And
these were the words he spoke to them:</p>

<p>“Little birds, little sisters mine, much are
you holden to God your Creator; and at all
times and in every place you ought to praise
Him. Freedom He has given you to fly everywhere;
and raiment He has given you, double
and threefold. More than this, He preserved
your kind in the Ark, so that your race might
not come to an end. Still more do you owe
Him for the element of air, which He has
made your portion. Over and above, you sow
not, neither do you reap; but God feeds you,
and gives you streams and springs for your
thirst; the mountains He gives you, and the
valleys for your refuge, and the tall trees
wherein to build your nests. And because you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
cannot sew or spin God takes thought to clothe
you, you and your little ones. It must be,
then, that your Creator loves you much, since
He has granted you so many benefits. Be on
your guard then against the sin of ingratitude,
and strive always to give God praise.”</p>

<p>And when the Saint ceased speaking, the
birds made such signs as they might, by spreading
their wings and opening their beaks, to
show their love and pleasure; and when he
had blessed them, they sprang up, and singing
songs of unspeakable sweetness, away they
streamed in a great cross to the four quarters
of heaven.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="PROSERPINA_AND_KING_PLUTO">PROSERPINA AND KING PLUTO</h3>

</div>

<p>Little Proserpina and Mother Ceres lived in
the beautiful valley of Enna where the warm
sun shone all the year round. Mother Ceres
had plenty of work to do. Each day she made
a journey to the meadows, orchards, and fields
all over the earth. Indeed it was through her
watchful care that the grass grew, and flowers
bloomed, that the fruit ripened, and the precious
crops of barley, wheat, and rye brought
forth a bountiful harvest.</p>

<p>One day at dawn a shining car and a pair of
restless winged dragons stood waiting to take
Mother Ceres on her daily journey. The
dragons were impatient to start, for they knew
how much work had to be done each day.
Very soon Ceres glided forth and mounted
her splendid car. She was clothed in flowing
robes of the softest grey and on her head she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
wore a crown of scarlet poppies and golden
wheat.</p>

<p>“Farewell, little daughter,” she called. “I
shall come back before the dew falls. Do not
venture out of the valley to-day. Farewell!”
Off sped the winged dragons with Mother
Ceres. Little Proserpina did not mind being
left in the valley for she found a good deal of
amusement there. Her friends the naiads—beautiful
water nymphs—sported about in the
cool fountains. Proserpina loved to spend a
quiet hour with these gentle maidens. She
often played a merry game with Echo, a
nymph who lived on a far-off wooded hillside;
sometimes she danced in the sunshine with her
little playmates.</p>

<p>Mother Ceres’ shining car soon disappeared
and little Proserpina ran to some of her companions
and said, “Come, come! I hear Pan,
the shepherd boy, playing the sweetest music
on his reed-pipes! Let us dance in the sunshine!
Come!”</p>

<p>In her gayest mood she led the dance to the
very edge of a deep wood which bordered the
valley. Then the train of little maidens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
stopped suddenly and listened. Peals of boisterous
laughter broke the silence. In the
depths of the forest the queerest youths were
rollicking about. They had snub noses, hairy
ears, and tiny sprouting horns; their hips were
covered with shaggy hair and their feet were
exactly like a goat’s.</p>

<p>“Hush,” whispered Proserpina, “the madcap
satyrs are dancing too. Let us hasten
away.”</p>

<p>“We will gather flowers and make garlands,”
said one of the maidens.</p>

<p>They slipped quietly away from the noisy
wood and ran about in all directions to search
for fragrant blossoms,—lilies and violets,
hyacinth bells and pinks. The little maidens
soon filled their arms with flowers and sat
down on a mossy bank to weave garlands.</p>

<p>In her eagerness to find the loveliest blossoms
Proserpina had sauntered off a long way
from her companions. She could hear the
faint echo of their merry voices in the distance.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have wandered out of the valley,”
she thought. “I must hasten back with these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
lovely flowers. What beauties I have found!”</p>

<p>She turned to run toward the bank where
her companions were sitting, when she heard a
queer rumbling noise. What could it be! It
sounded exactly like distant thunder, yet
there was not a cloud in the blue sky overhead.
There was another rumbling. Was it
coming nearer? The earth beneath her feet
quivered! Then in breathless fear she saw a
great crack in the field! She was too frightened
to move or speak. The flowers she had
gathered dropped from her trembling hands.
Out of the great cavity which seemed to widen
every moment Proserpina saw dashing toward
her four jet black horses with flashing eyes
and quivering nostrils. At their heels whirled
a wonderful golden chariot with jewelled
wheels. Standing in this splendid car was a
dark-browed man whose iron-crown was
studded with precious stones of many colours.
In one hand he lightly held the reins and
guided the fiery steeds; in the other, he held
a two-pronged fork.</p>

<p>“King Pluto!” gasped Proserpina. In a
twinkling the King of the Underworld leaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
from his chariot, seized Proserpina in his
arms, mounted his chariot again and sped away
over the hills.</p>

<p>Proserpina’s low cry of “Help! help!
Mother! Mother Ceres!” was too faint to
reach the ears of the merry companions who
were very busy with their flowers.</p>

<p>“What has become of Proserpina?” cried
one of them when she had finished her garland.</p>

<p>They looked in the direction where but a
moment ago Proserpina was gathering flowers,
but they could not see her.</p>

<p>“I wonder where she has gone,” said another.
“Surely she has not wandered out of
the valley!”</p>

<p>“Proserpina! Proserpina!” called the little
companions becoming alarmed.</p>

<p>But no answer could come from the captured
maiden who was whirling along beyond
the distant hills. In vain did the dark-browed
King try to calm his captive by declaring that
no harm should come to her. In vain did he
promise that she should share his throne and
his riches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>“I want to go home to Mother Ceres,”
sobbed Proserpina.</p>

<p>But King Pluto was deaf to her pleading;
he urged his horses to go faster and faster until
finally they came to the River Cyane whose
waters began to seethe and foam in a very
threatening manner. Little Proserpina knew
the waters of this river were angry because
she was made a captive. Quickly she loosened
her girdle and flung it into the raging flood.
Now King Pluto was afraid to risk his fiery
steeds in the angry stream, so he determined to
plunge at once into the depths of his kingdom.
With his two-pronged fork he struck a mighty
blow on the earth. Instantly a great crevice
opened and gave him passage to the Underworld.</p>

<p>Phœbus Apollo had almost finished his
day’s journey and was driving his beautiful
sun-car down the steep slope of the western
sky. Mother Ceres’ winged dragons were
hastening to the valley of Enna. Proserpina
always bounded forth with a cry of welcome,
so when Mother Ceres missed her little daughter’s
joyous words she called, “Proserpina!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Proserpina!” There was no answer. What
could be the matter! Mother Ceres’ heart
beat fast! She sought the little maidens of the
valley who were her daughter’s playmates and
listened in trembling fear to the story they
told about Proserpina’s sudden disappearance.
Ceres lighted a torch and continued her search
all night. At dawn the distracted mother was
in despair, for she could find no trace of her
lost child. She questioned the Naiads, the
Nymphs, Pan, the shepherd boy, and Echo,
but not one of them could give her tidings of
Proserpina. For a long time the poor mother
continued her wanderings from dawn until
eventide all the world over.</p>

<p>One day she happened to wander near the
River Cyane and there floating near the
water’s edge she saw Proserpina’s girdle.
Eagerly she grasped it in her hands and stood
in breathless silence. A low murmuring
sound reached her ears. Did it come from a
nearby fountain? Ceres listened very carefully.
“Proserpina! King Pluto!” whispered
a voice from the cool depths of the clear
water. In a moment Mother Ceres knew the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
truth about her little daughter’s disappearance.
She had been captured by the King of
the Underworld! Ceres could take no comfort
in this knowledge for she knew King Pluto
would do all in his power to keep his captive.
In despair the poor mother withdrew to a
dark cave to nurse her grief.</p>

<p>“Until Proserpina is returned to me no vegetation
shall grow on the earth,” vowed Mother
Ceres.</p>

<p>The gentle rain no longer refreshed the
grass and drooping flowers; the withered
leaves dropped from the trees; the fruit became
parched and dry, and the precious
grain failed to ripen! Alas! Famine spread
throughout the land!</p>

<p>“Mother Ceres,” cried the people, “we implore
you to give us your aid. Bring back
the flowers and the fruit, and the grain. We
shall starve without your help.”</p>

<p>“Not until my child is returned to me,” answered
Ceres.</p>

<p>Finally Jupiter’s heart was touched by the
distress of the people. He sent for Mother
Ceres and said, “If your daughter Proserpina<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
has refused to eat any of King Pluto’s pomegranate
seeds during her stay in the underworld
she shall return to the earth and never
again disappear. My swift-footed messenger
Mercury shall go at once to Pluto’s palace
and state my will in this matter.”</p>

<p>Mercury put on his wonderful cap and
winged sandals and sped away to deliver Jupiter’s
message. At first King Pluto was angry
when he heard that his merry little companion
was to be taken from him, but of course he
could not disregard Jupiter’s command, so
Proserpina was led back into the sunlight.</p>

<p>How happy Mother Ceres was! She could
not keep back tears of joy.</p>

<p>“Now the fields shall be covered with verdure;
the soft showers shall fall and earth shall
bring forth a bountiful harvest!” she declared.
“Proserpina, my child, you shall never again
leave me. King Pluto cannot demand your
return unless you have eaten some of his pomegranate
seeds.”</p>

<p>Then little Proserpina looked up into her
mother’s face and said, “Mother dear, I must
tell you the truth. A little while before Mercury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
came with his message I ate six of King
Pluto’s pomegranate seeds. I was very, very
hungry, mother.”</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas!” cried Ceres, feeling alarmed
again. She hastened to Jupiter and asked him
what could be done. Jupiter looked very
serious, and finally decreed that for each
pomegranate seed which Proserpina had eaten
she should spend one month of each year in
King Pluto’s Kingdom.</p>

<p>“Six months of each year my child must
spend in that dark underworld! It is dreadful!”
declared Ceres.</p>

<p>“Do not grieve, mother,” said Proserpina
cheerily. “At first the dark-browed King
frightened me very much but I soon found
that he is kind and gracious. Let us be happy
because I am to spend six months of each year
here with you. During my stay with King
Pluto you shall take a long rest from your
hard work in the fields.”</p>

<p>So it happened that Proserpina spent half
of each year in the dark underworld. But
every springtime when the warm sun gladdened
the earth, Mercury was sent to bring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Proserpina back to Mother Ceres. And at
the coming of the joyous little maiden the
grass leaped forth in the brown fields, flowers
gay brightened the meadows and from the tops
of the budding trees the birds carolled songs
of welcome.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friedrich Adolph Krummacher</span></p>

</div>

<p>One day in the springtime, a youth was sitting
under the palm trees in the garden of his
father, the King. He was deep in thought.
There came to him Nathan, the Prophet, saying,
“Prince, why musest thou so earnestly under
the palm trees?”</p>

<p>The Prince lifted his head and answered,
“Nathan, I would see a wonder.”</p>

<p>The Prophet smiled and answered: “The
same wish had I also in the days of my youth.”</p>

<p>“And was it fulfilled?” asked the King’s
son, hastily.</p>

<p>“A Man of God came to me,” said Nathan,
“having a pomegranate seed in his hand. Behold,’
he said, ‘what will come from this seed.’
Then with his finger he made a hole in the
earth, planted the seed and covered it. When
he withdrew his hands the clods parted one
from another and I saw two small leaves coming
forth. But scarcely had I beheld them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
when they joined together and became a round
stem wrapped in bark, and the stem increased
before my eyes and grew higher and thicker.
Then the Man of God said to me, ‘Give heed!’
And as I looked, I saw many branches spread
forth from the stem like great arms. I marvelled
but the Man of God motioned me to
keep silence. ‘Give heed,’ he said, ‘new creations
begin.’</p>

<p>“Then he took water in the hollow of his
hand from the rivulet by the wayside, and
sprinkled the branches three times, and, lo,
the branches were covered with green leaves,
so that a cool shade spread over us and sweet
odours filled the air.</p>

<p>“‘From whence comes this perfume and this
reviving shade?’ cried I.</p>

<p>“‘Dost thou not see,’ said the Man of God,
‘these crimson flowers bursting from among
the green leaves and hanging in clusters?’ I
was about to speak but a gentle breeze moved
the leaves, scattering the flowers among us,
as when snow descendeth from the clouds.
Scarcely had the falling flowers reached the
ground when I saw the ruddy pomegranates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
hanging between the leaves like the almonds
on Aaron’s rod. Then the Man of God left
me lost in wonder.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of this Man of God? Is
he yet alive?”</p>

<p>“Son of David,” answered the Prophet, “I
have spoken to thee of a vision.”</p>

<p>When the Prince heard these words he was
grieved in his heart.</p>

<p>“How couldst thou deceive me thus?” he
asked.</p>

<p>But the Prophet replied, “I have not deceived
thee. Behold in thy father’s garden
thou mayest see in reality what I have told
thee. Dost not this same wonder happen to
the pomegranate trees and all the other trees
in the garden?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Prince, “but you cannot
see it, and it comes to pass through a long
time.”</p>

<p>“Is it less wonderful because it cometh to
pass in silence and unheeded? Learn to know
nature and her workings, then wilt thou long
no more for a wonder performed by the hand
of man.”</p>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little grain of
Wheat. It was a tiny brown thing, quite hard
and dry. It looked like somebody who had
wrapped himself up in a cloak and gone to
sleep, with his head and feet and all covered
up. That was really what had happened.
The grain of Wheat was fast asleep.</p>

<p>It lay outside a farm-yard gate, and a little
black ant came along and saw it. “Dear me!”
said the little black ant, “that will do nicely
for my dinner.” He was carrying it off—which
was hard work, because it was nearly as
big as he was—when another little black ant
came along.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you to carry that if you’ll give me
half,” said the second ant. “Shan’t!” said
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>the first. Then, I am sorry to say, they fought
about it.</p>

<p>While they were biting and kicking, and
the grain of Wheat was rolling about between
them, a third person came along.</p>

<p>The third person was a little Elf-man. He
was looking about for winter lodgings: and
he had just found a capital place in a hollow
tree at the edge of a field.</p>

<p>“Shocking! shocking!” said he to the two
fighting ants. “Do stop, for goodness’ sake!”
But they did not take the least notice of him.</p>

<p>Then the little Elf-man thought, “If I take
that grain of Wheat away, they won’t have
anything left to quarrel about!” And so he
did.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little Elf-man took the grain of Wheat
very carefully home to his hollow tree. But
when he arrived, it was all dark, because his
tame glow-worm, that he kept for a candle,
had felt lonely and gone out for a walk. He
bumped his head trying to find things in the
dark, and dropped the grain of Wheat; and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
rolled out of the tree and down into a tiny
chink of the earth.</p>

<p>The little Elf-man was dreadfully sorry at
losing it, and scolded the glow-worm when it
came home. He spent many hours searching
for the grain next morning.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” said his friend
the Dormouse. The Dormouse lived in a hole
in the hedge-bank.</p>

<p>“For a grain I’ve lost,” said the Elf.</p>

<p>“There’s a Barley grain under that loose
sod,” remarked the Dormouse.</p>

<p>“That’s not it, thank you,” said the Elf-man.
And he went on hunting; but he had no success.
It was ever so deep down.</p>

<p>A good many days went by, and several
things happened,—rain, and wind, and sunshine,
and more rain, and snow, and frost, and
rain again.</p>

<p>They all came down to where the little
grain lay underground; and its nice brown
cloak did not remain smooth and dry. It became
damp and sodden and dirty. Its appearance
was certainly not improved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Now, if you got all wet and cold while
you were asleep, supposing the wind and rain
blew in on you, it would wake you up, most
likely. So it fell out to the little grain of
Wheat.</p>

<p>It woke up one day, inside its wet ragged
cloak, and thrust out its small white
feet. They were not like your feet, they were
more like little roots—but they did very well
for the Wheat. Its legs grew longer, week
by week, and it grew more and more awake
every day.</p>

<p>The more it waked, the less it liked being
down there in the dark and cold. It thought,
“Really, I can’t stay here all my life! There’s
nothing to look at!”</p>

<p>But whenever it wanted to poke its head up
and peep out, the wind made it shiver and feel
miserable. So it stayed where it was, and
tried to be contented. One can always <i>try</i>,
anyhow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little Barley-corn under the
loose sod was getting on rather badly. You
see, it had not been tucked cosily into the soil
like the Wheat. It was like a poor little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
vagrant with no proper place to sleep in. It
grew, but very slowly.</p>

<p>“Hullo! is that you?” said the Dormouse,
peeping in one day under the sod; “are you
awake?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ve been properly to sleep,”
said the Barley-corn.</p>

<p>“Make haste and grow a little faster, and
come out of that,” said the Dormouse. “I
should be rather fond of you if I thought you
were taking trouble to get on.”</p>

<p>“I think if any one were fond of me,” whispered
the Barley-corn, “I <i>should grow</i>.”</p>

<p>But the Dormouse was not listening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At last a sunbeam came along the field—several
sunbeams, in fact. They were quite
bright and warm, and the little Elf-man, who
had kept close indoors all the bad weather,
opened his door and sat on the threshold basking.
Then the sunbeams burrowed right
down into the earth, and said: “Hurry up!
Is anybody here for out-of-doors?”</p>

<p>You could not have heard them; their voices
were not like ours. But the grain of Wheat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
heard them. At once it threw off the last rags
of its tattered old cloak; and it was as clean
and white as possible underneath. Then it
pushed up its little green head, with a two-horned
peaked cap on, and looked out curiously
upon the world.</p>

<p>Everything was clear, and warm, and sunny,
and perfectly delightful. And there was the
little Elf-man sitting on his threshold, in a
<i>one</i>-horned peaky green cap.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” said the Elf-man.
“Who’s this?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Wheat,” said the little green
head.</p>

<p>“Then you’ve changed very much, let me
tell you,” said the Elf-man; “you are not a
bit like what you were; but ever so much
better.”</p>

<p>“I hope I shall go on improving,” said the
Wheat politely. And that is just what it actually
did.</p>

<p>But the poor Barley-corn was only beginning
to push through under the loose sod by
the time the Wheat was six inches high. It
was thin and stunted, just as you would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
if you had no proper food, and nobody to be
fond of you.</p>

<p>The Wheat took no notice of it. But the
Dormouse came now and then and said, “How
slow you are!” The little Elf-man was
rather sorry for it, but it did not occur to him
to say so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little Elf-man came out every day, and
talked to the Wheat while it grew. Very soon
it was much bigger than he was; but this did
not make him conceited.</p>

<p>“Did you have nice dreams while you were
down below there?” he asked it.</p>

<p>“I only had one dream,” said the Wheat,
“but that went on all the time. I dreamed
I was very tall and golden-yellow, and lived
along with a crowd of brothers and sisters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you didn’t,” said the Elf-man; “I
found you all by yourself. You were a poor
little lonely brown thing.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said the Wheat: “that was
my dream. And I have it now, sometimes,
if I shut my eyes.”</p>

<p>The little Elf-man was greatly puzzled:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
but the Wheat was now so tall that he did not
like to contradict.</p>

<p>As for the little Barley-corn, nobody took
the least interest in <i>his</i> dreams. He had very
delightful ones, too. But they were the kind
that never come true.</p>

<p>The summer went on, and all sorts of friends
came and talked to the Wheat—birds, bees,
and butterflies. He enjoyed himself more
and more. The taller he grew, the better
view he had of the rest of the world.</p>

<p>He had very pretty green clothes, which
grew bigger as he did. This was a really useful
arrangement: he never required to be
measured for a new suit.</p>

<p>One day he said to the little Elf-man, “Do
your clothes change colour?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the Elf-man, “I always wear
green. Even in the winter I can find some
blades of grass to weave together, or a few
leaves to stitch up into a coat.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand me,” said the Wheat.
“I mean, do they turn to a different colour
while you’re wearing them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” said the Elf-man.</p>

<p>“Well, mine do,” said the Wheat. “Just
look!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, his green clothes were turning
yellow, and he was changing colour all
over, too. He was very much altered altogether.
It was most surprising.</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” said the little Elf-man.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I think,” said the
Wheat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About a month after this, the Elf-man was
getting his breakfast ready,—an acorn-cup
full of dew, and a drop of wild honey,—when
he heard a loud, eager voice calling him. It
was the Wheat, very much excited.</p>

<p>“I’ve had that dream several times lately,”
said the Wheat, rocking to and fro, “and now
it has come true!”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked the Elf-man.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see?” said the Wheat. “I’ve
turned golden-yellow from head to foot. And
I have a whole family of children. They’re
not <i>my</i> brothers and sisters, of course, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
they’re each other’s,—so it comes to the same
thing. Dear, dear, how happy I do feel!”
And it rocked more than ever.</p>

<p>“How many are there?” asked the Elf.</p>

<p>“About twenty, I should think,” answered
the Wheat, “but I can’t count them without
cricking my neck.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said the little Elf. “It’s a
large family to look after. It reminds me of a
little rhyme I once heard, about an old woman
who lived in a shoe.”</p>

<p>“The more the merrier,” said the Wheat.
“Hush, children! Don’t all talk at once!”
But the little grains would not stop talking
all at once; and although <i>you</i> could not have
heard them—their voices were too tinkly and
tiny—it was perfectly deafening to any one
who could.</p>

<p>The Elf-man went back into his house and
shut the door. Presently he had to put some
cotton-willow-wool in his ears. The Wheat
tried to sing its children to sleep with lullabies;
but it did not know any.</p>

<p>“I shall never have a merry family like that,
I’m afraid,” said the Barley-corn to the Dormouse.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
The Barley-corn had hardly grown
two inches since the spring. In fact, he was
so little, you would hardly have known he was
there.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the Dormouse. “You
have me to talk to you, haven’t you?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By and by the Wheat got very tired. Just
think, if your mother had more than twenty
children, who never stopped talking all day
and all night! Anyhow, the Wheat could endure
it no longer. So it called to the little
Elf-man, and said, “Kindly fetch me the Dormouse.
I can see him now, on the bank at
the end of the field. He’s beginning to get
sleepy, too, so please make haste.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me for?” said the Dormouse,
when he was fetched. He and the
Elf stood staring up at the tall Wheat. The
little grains were quieter now. They had said
nearly all they had to say.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” said the Wheat in weary
tones. “I can’t rock these children to sleep up
here. It’s too light, and too draughty. They
must be put to bed in the earth, as I was. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
sure it’s the proper place for them.” As the
Wheat spoke, all the little grains fell suddenly
fast asleep.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not a nurse,” said the Dormouse,
rather grumpily, because he had been disturbed.
“And I can’t climb your stalk and
fetch them down, either.”</p>

<p>“You must bite my stalk right through,”
said the Wheat, “so that we can all lie down
together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will hurt you dreadfully!” cried
the little Elf-man.</p>

<p>“Then it will have to hurt, that’s all,” said
the Wheat. “It’s the only thing to do. Be
quick!”</p>

<p>The little Elf-man threw his arms round
the Wheat’s yellow-stalk, and wept. But the
Dormouse, with his sharp little teeth, bit
through the stalk, just where it came out of the
ground. The Wheat gave one great rock—and
one sigh—and SNAP!—down it came.
All the little grains tumbled out of their
cradles, and rolled into chinks of the soil.</p>

<p>The tall Wheat, as it lay in the earth, said
“Thank you!” in a husky voice to the Dormouse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
and “Good-bye!” to the little Elf-man.
The wind blew it away that night, and nobody
ever saw it again.</p>

<p>“Where’s the Barley?” asked the Dormouse
next day. But the poor Barley was quite
shrivelled up.</p>

<p>The little Elf-man was sad for nearly a
week. But when all the little grains woke up
the following spring, he had a jollier time than
ever.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_LITTLE_ACORN">THE LITTLE ACORN</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lucy Wheelock</span></p>

</div>

<p>It was a little acorn that hung on the bough
of a tree. It had a tender green cup and a
beautifully carved saucer to hold it. The
mother oak fed it with sweet sap every day,
the birds sang good-night songs above it, and
the wind rocked it gently to and fro. The
oak leaves made a soft green shade above it,
so the sun could not shine too warm on its
green cover, and it was as happy as an acorn
could be.</p>

<p>There were many other acorns on the tree,
and I am sure the mother often whispered
loving words to all her babies.</p>

<p>The summer days were so bright and pleasant
that the acorn never thought of anything
but sunshine and an occasional shower to wash
the dust off the leaves.</p>

<p>But you know that summer ends and the
autumn days come. The green cup of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
acorn turned to a brown cup, and it was well
that it grew stiffer and harder, for the cold
winds began to blow.</p>

<p>The leaves turned from green to golden
brown, and some of them were whisked away
by the rough wind. The little acorn began
to grow uneasy.</p>

<p>“Isn’t life all summer?” it said.</p>

<p>“No,” whispered the mother oak, “the cold
days come and the leaves must go and the
acorns too. I must soon lose my babies.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I could never leave this kind bough,”
said the frightened acorn. “I should be lost
and forgotten if I were to fall.”</p>

<p>So it tried to cling all the closer to its bough;
but at last it was alone there. The leaves
were blown away, and some of them had made
a blanket for the brown acorns lying on the
ground.</p>

<p>One night the tree whispered this message
to the lonely acorn: “This tree is only your
home for a time. This is not your true life.
Your brown shell is only the cover for a living
plant, which can never be set free until
the hard shell drops away, and that can never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
happen until you are buried in the ground and
wait for the spring to call you into life. So let
go, little acorn, and fall to the ground, and
some day you will wake to a new and glorious
life.”</p>

<p>The acorn listened and believed, for was
not the tree its sheltering mother? So it bade
her farewell, and, loosing its hold, dropped
to the ground.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, it seemed as if the acorn were
lost. That night a high wind blew and covered
it deep under a heap of oak leaves. The
next day a cold rain washed the leaves closer
together, and trickling streams from the hillside
swept some earth over them. The acorn
was buried. “But I shall wake again,” it
said, and so it fell asleep. It might have been
cold; but the frost fairies wove a soft, white
snow blanket to cover it, and so it was kept
warm.</p>

<p>If you had walked through the woods that
winter, you would have said the acorn was
gone, but then you could not have seen the
life slumbering within the brown cover. But
spring came and called to all the sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
things underground to waken and come forth.
The acorn heard and tried to move, but the
brown shell held it fast. Some raindrops
trickled through the ground to moisten the
shell, and one day the pushing life within
was set free. The brown shell was of no more
use and was lost in the ground, but the young
plant was to live. It heard voices calling it
upward. It must arise. “A new and glorious
life,” the mother oak had said.</p>

<p>“I must arise,” the acorn said, and up the
living plant came, up to the world of sunshine
and beauty. It looked around. There was
the same green moss in the woods, the same
singing brook.</p>

<p>“And I shall live and grow,” it said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” called the mother oak, “you are now
an oak tree. This is your real life.”</p>

<p>And the tiny oak tree was glad and tried to
stretch higher towards the sun.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">George MacDonald</span></p>

</div>

<p>Long, long ago, two seeds lay beside each
other in the earth, waiting. It was cold, and
rather wearisome and, to beguile the time,
the one found means to speak to the other.</p>

<p>“What are you going to be?” said the one.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the other.</p>

<p>“For me,” rejoined the first, “I mean to be
a rose. There is nothing like a splendid rose.
Everybody will love me then.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” whispered the second; and
that was all he could say; for somehow when
he had said that, he felt as if all the words in
the world were used up. So they were silent
again for a day or two.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried the first, “I have had some
water. I never knew till it was inside me.
I’m growing! I’m growing! Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” repeated the other, and lay
still; and waited more than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>The first grew and grew, pushing itself
straight up, till at last it felt that it was in the
open air, for it could breathe. And what a
delicious breath that was! It was rather cold,
but so refreshing. The flower could see nothing,
for it was not quite a flower yet, only a
plant; and they never see till their eyes come,
that is, till they open their blossoms,—then
they are flowers quite. So it grew and grew,
and kept its head up very steadily, meaning to
see the sky the first thing, and leave the earth
quite behind as well as beneath it. But somehow
or other, though why it could not tell,
it felt very much inclined to cry. At length
it opened its eye. It was morning, and the
sky <i>was</i> over its head but, alas! itself was no
rose,—only a tiny white flower. It felt more
inclined to hang down its head and to cry
but it still resisted, and tried hard to open its
eye wide, and to hold its head upright, and to
look full at the sky.</p>

<p>“I will be a star of Bethlehem, at least!” said
the flower to itself.</p>

<p>But its head felt very heavy and a cold
wind rushed over it, and bowed it down towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the earth. And the flower saw that the
time of the singing of birds was not come,
that the snow covered the whole land, and that
there was not a single flower in sight but itself.
And it half-closed its leaves. But that
instant it remembered what the other flower
used to say; and it said to itself, “It’s all right;
I will be what I can.” And thereon it yielded
to the wind, dropped its head to the earth, and
looked no more on the sky, but on the snow.
And straightway the wind stopped, and the
cold died away, and the snow sparkled like
pearls, and diamonds; and the flower knew
that it was the holding of its head up that had
hurt it so; for that its body came of the snow,
and that its name was Snow-drop. And so it
said once more, “It’s all right!” and waited in
perfect peace. All the rest it needed was to
hang its head after its nature.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jay T. Stocking</span></p>

</div>

<p>Ever so many centuries ago the world was
bare and grey as the street. The Earth King
grew very tired of it, and covered the earth
with a beautiful carpet of green. We call it
grass. For years and years there was nothing
but green, until the Earth King grew as tired
of the green as he had grown of the grey. He
decided that he must have more colours. So
one day he took his royal retinue and journeyed
to a hillside where he knew there grew the very
finest grasses in all the kingdom. At a blast
of the King’s bugler the grasses assembled,
and the King addressed them in simple words:
“My faithful grasses. It is many years since
I placed you here. You have been faithful.
You have kept true green. It now pleases
me to announce to you that I am about to reward
a certain number of you and make you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
to be lords and ladies of the field. To-morrow
I shall come hither at this same hour.
You are to assemble before me, and the fairest
of your number and the most pleasing I will
honour with great and lasting honour. Farewell.”</p>

<p>Then what a whispering and putting of
heads together there was among the grasses,
as the breeze crept up the hillside. They
arose next morning before the sun, that they
might wash their ribbons in the gleaming
pearls of dew. What prinking and preening!
What rustling of ruffles and sashes!
What burnishing of armour and spears! At
length the King’s bugle rang out that called
them to the grand assembly. Full of excitement,
they stood before the King, each hoping
that he might be chosen for one of the
great honours.</p>

<p>The King greeted them as on the previous
day, and told them again of the high honour
that he was about to bestow. “But,” said he,
“in this Court of Judgment I must have willing
servants to assist me. First, I must have a
keeper of the gate so that no outsider may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
enter. Which one of this host will be keeper
of the gate?”</p>

<p>Not a man-grass stirred in his tracks, for
each feared that if he became a servant of the
King, he would lose his chance to be made a
lord.</p>

<p>“Which one?” asked the King again;
“which one will volunteer to keep the gate for
me?”</p>

<p>At this moment a sturdy grass was seen coming
down the hillside. He was not handsome,
but he was strong, his shoulders were broad,
and his chest was deep, and he was armed to
the teeth. Spear points stuck from every
pocket, arrows filled his belt, and in each hand
he carried a lance sharp as lightning. “Let
these wait for their honours,” thought he, as
he said, “<i>I</i> will serve the King.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said the King; “take your station
at the gate. And now,” continued the King,
“I must have a herald to announce my awards
and my commands. Who will be my herald?”</p>

<p>Again there was silence among the man-grasses,
till at last one of them was seen to advance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
He was short and round and smiling,
as happy a grass as grew on the hill. He
came before the King as fast as his short legs
could carry him. “So it please the King, I’ll
be his royal herald.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” replied the King. “Stand here
at my feet.”</p>

<p>“Two torch-bearers I need,” said the King;
“two torch-bearers, tall and comely, to hold
the lights on high. Who will serve the King
as torch-bearers?”</p>

<p>And now there was silence and stiffness
among the lady-grasses, as each, fearing to lose
her chance to be made a lady, waited for the
others. At length two slender maidens advanced
with glowing faces and hesitant step.
They were not as beautiful, it must be said, as
some of their sisters. Their ribbons were few
and some of them frayed. They scarcely
knew whether the King would accept them,
but they meekly offered themselves. “We, O
King, will be your torch-bearers.”</p>

<p>The King looked pleased enough as he replied,
“So be it, indeed. Stand here on either
hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“And now,” continued the King, “I must
have an incense bearer, to swing my censer
over the meadows. Who will be my incense
bearer?”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence again
among the lady-grasses, but only a moment,
for out stepped one of the daintiest of them all.
She tripped quickly and quietly down the hill
to the King, saying modestly as she approached,
“I will be your incense bearer.”</p>

<p>“Let it be so,” said the King. “Await my
commands.”</p>

<p>“Yet one more willing servant,” said the
King; “one more. Who will ring the chimes?
Man or maid, who among all these loyal subjects
will ring the chimes?”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the King’s words left his lips,
when one of the noblest grasses of all, her
broad green ribbons rustling as she moved,
left the crowded ranks of the ladies and eagerly
advanced before the King. “If it please
Your Majesty, I will ring the chimes.”</p>

<p>Then the King looked around satisfied upon
his eager and expectant audience, and spoke
a few brief words to them. He had come,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
he said, fearing that the task was almost too
great even for a king—to choose among so
many and so beautiful subjects. But they had
chosen for themselves, and he had now only
to award the honours.</p>

<p>“Keeper of the gate,” he commanded,
“stand before the King!”</p>

<p>The keeper of the gate came awkwardly
forward, pricking all who brushed against
him as he passed.</p>

<p>“Because you have been willing to serve the
King,” said the monarch, “I reward you with
distinguished honour.” Then, taking from
the hand of a page a great velvet cap of purplish
red, he placed it upon the head of the
Gate-Keeper, saying as he did so, “I dub you:
My Lord, the Thistle.”</p>

<p>“Let the King’s herald stand forth!”</p>

<p>The little round happy herald obeyed and
knelt before the King. The King took a great
golden coronet from the hand of a page and
placed it upon his head, saying as he did so,
“Because of your readiness to serve your
King, I create you a noble of the field, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
dub you: My Lord, the Dandelion. And I
give you this trumpet on which to blow.”</p>

<p>“Let the torch-bearers stand forth!”</p>

<p>Then the two shy maidens from either side
of the King bowed before him. On the head
of each the King placed a shining crown, one
all gold, and one gold rimmed with white,
that they might not be confused, and he said
to them, “Because of your generous deed I
dub you: Lady Buttercup and Lady Daisy.”</p>

<p>“My incense bearer!”</p>

<p>The dainty maiden courtesied at his feet
and, blushing, bowed her head.</p>

<p>The King beckoned to a page, who brought
him a tiny hood of most becoming blue. This
the King placed upon her head, saying the
while: “The King is grateful for your service.
I dub you: Lady Violet.”</p>

<p>“The ringer of the royal chimes, let her appear.”</p>

<p>The beautiful grass with the broad, shining
ribbons stood proudly before him, and bowed
her head in salute. The King took a silver
bell and gave it to her, saying as he did so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
“This shall be the sign of your royal office.
I dub you: Lady Lily-of-the-Field.”</p>

<p>The King then charged his new-made lords
and ladies that they should be faithful to
their offices and never cease, year by year, to
beautify the earth. Then the assembly was
dissolved, but not until the whole host of
grasses on the hillside had applauded what
the King had done. They were disappointed
and grieved, it is true, but they were not too
jealous to know that the bravest and truest and
most beautiful had been crowned with honour
due.</p>

</div>

<p>The bleak wind swept across the great lakes
and piled snow-drifts all around a wigwam
which stood at the edge of a pine forest. An
Indian pulled aside a curtain of wolf-skin and
stood listening in the doorway of his rude
house. His dark eyes were fixed on the
richly-tinted western sky. Long hair white
as the frost fell about his bent shoulders and
framed a thin dark face deeply lined with
wrinkles.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard footsteps,” he muttered
in a weak voice. He drew a deerskin mantle
close about his shoulders, turned from the
doorway and sat down on a mat of beaver fur
which lay before a few dying embers. A
shiver ran through his gaunt figure. He
stirred the smouldering ashes and threw some
dried sticks into the small flame.</p>

<p>“How weak and weary I am to-night,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
thought. “What has become of the hunter’s
game? I could find none in the forest to-day.”
His head drooped forward and he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>At sunrise he was aroused by a flood of light
in the wigwam. He looked up and saw standing
in the doorway a beautiful maiden, clad
in a robe of sweet-grass and ferns. Her
moccasins were made of velvet mosses, and the
fairest blossoms were entwined in her long
dark hair. She carried an armful of budding
twigs.</p>

<p>“Who art thou?” cried the old man.</p>

<p>“I am the Spring Manito,” she answered,
merrily.</p>

<p>“Then thou wilt perish here,” said the old
man, “for alas! I have no cheer to offer thee!”</p>

<p>“Art thou the great Winter Manito?” asked
the maiden.</p>

<p>“I am the great Winter Manito! Thou
hast no doubt heard of my power. At my
command the North Wind rushes madly
through the forest and the giant trees bow before
him as he twists and tears their branches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Cruel Manito,” sighed the maiden, but the
old man did not hear her.</p>

<p>“I cover the pine-trees with sleet and drive
the birds southward. With my sceptre of ice
I silence the brooks and rivers. My breath
turns the dew into frost. I shake my locks
and a face-cloth of snow covers the withered
leaves and blossoms. Mighty is the Winter
Manito!”</p>

<p>“Mighty is the Winter Manito,” repeated
the Maiden, sadly. “But my power is greater
than his!”</p>

<p>“What meanest thou?” asked the old man
quickly.</p>

<p>“At my call the soft breezes from the South
caress the trees and heal the wounds the Winter
Manito has made. My warm breath
turns the frost into dew; my golden wand
melts the frozen streams and their waters flow
again toward the sea. I shake my tresses and
the gentle rain falls; then the velvet buds burst
forth and the birds hasten back to build their
nests and to sing in the leafy branches.
Where I walk in the fields and meadows the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
grass and blossoms spring forth to greet me.
The children of the red men rejoice in the
beauty which I bring to gladden the earth.
The Winter Manito is mighty but his is the
power of cruelty; the Spring Manito is strong,
and hers is the strength of kindness. The
Winter Manito’s sceptre is the biting frost;
his rule brings pain and death; the Spring
Manito bears the golden wand of sunshine
and her hand-maidens bring joy and life.”</p>

<p>As she spoke the maiden noticed that the
old man grew weaker and weaker until he
finally sank down on the floor of his lodge. A
flood of sunshine filled the wigwam. The
Winter Manito grew smaller and smaller until
he disappeared. Then the old man’s tent
faded away and left the maiden standing under
a tree. The sunshine had melted the
snowdrifts, and a warm breeze was blowing.</p>

<p>The maiden stooped down and brushed
away the dried leaves which had lain all winter
under the snow. Then she enamelled the
brown earth about her feet with star-like blossoms,
pink and white, and shining green
leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“My precious Arbutus,” she whispered,
bending low, “thou art born to bring joy to
the children of the red men and thou shalt
trail after me through the pine-forest and
over the distant hilltops.”</p>

<p>She moved quickly through the woods and
across the meadows. “Spring has come,”
whispered the trees and flowers. “Spring has
come,” sang the birds. Wherever she stepped
the lovely Arbutus trailed after her on its delicate
rosy vine and scented the air with sweetest
fragrance.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Henry Ward Beecher</span></p>

</div>

<p>Once there was a little girl whose name was
Clara. She had a very kind heart; but she
was an only child and had been petted so much
that she was becoming very selfish. Too late
the mother lamented that she had indulged
her child, and strove to repair the mischief by
trying to make Clara think of other people’s
happiness, not solely of her own.</p>

<p>On some days, no one could be more charming
than Clara. She was gentle and obliging.
She sang all day long, and made every one
who came near her happy. Then everybody
admired her, and her mother and aunt were
sure that she was cured of her pettish disposition.
But the very next day all her charming
ways were changed. She wore a moody face.
She was no longer courteous, and every one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>who came near her felt the chill of her manner.</p>

<p>One summer’s night, Clara went to her
room. The moon was at its full, and was
shining through the window so brightly that
she needed no other light. Clara sat at the
window feeling very unhappy. She was
thinking over her conduct through the day,
and was trying to imagine how it could be
that on some days she was happy and on
others so wretched.</p>

<p>As she mused, she laid her head back on the
easy chair. No sooner had she shut her
eyes than a strange thing happened. A feeble
old man, carrying a basket, came into the
room. In his basket, which he seemed hardly
able to bear, were a handful of flowers and
two great stones.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” said the old man, “will
you help me for I am too old to carry this
load; please lighten it.” Clara looked at
him, pouting, and exclaimed, “Go away!”</p>

<p>“But I am weak and suffering,” he said;
“will you not lighten my load?” At last
Clara took the flowers out of his basket.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
They were very beautiful and she laid them
in her lap.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” said the old man, “you have
not lightened my basket; you have taken only
the pleasant things out of it, and have left the
heavy stones. Please lift one of them out of
the basket.”</p>

<p>“Go away!” exclaimed Clara angrily. “I
will not touch those dirty stones!”</p>

<p>No sooner had she said this than the old
man began to change before her and to become
so bright and white that he looked like a
column of crystal. He took one of the stones
and cast it out of the window, and it flew and
flew, and fell on the eastern side of a grove
where the sun shone first every morning.</p>

<p>Then the crystal old man took the flowers
out of Clara’s lap. They were wet with dew,
and he shook them over her head and exclaimed,
“Change into a flower! Go and
stand by the stone till your shadow shall be
marked upon it.”</p>

<p>In a second, Clara was growing by the side
of the wide, flat stone, and the moon cast upon
it her shadow,—the shadow of a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
flower with a long and slender stem. All
night she was very wretched. In the morning,
she could not help looking at herself in
a brook which came close up to the stone;
then she recognised the beautiful flower and
knew that her name was now Columbine.</p>

<p>All day her shadow fell upon the stone, but
when the sun went away, the shadow, too,
went away. At night her faint shadow lay
upon the stone but when the moon went away,
her shadow, also, went away. And the stone
lay still all day and all night, and did not care
for the flower nor feel its shadow.</p>

<p>Clara longed to be a little girl again. She
asked the stone to tell her how, but the hard
stone would not answer. She asked the
brook, but the brook whispered, “Ask the
Bobolink!” She asked the Bobolink, but he
merely alighted upon the flower and teetered
up and down. She could not learn from the
Bobolink how to make her shadow stay upon
the stone.</p>

<p>Then she asked a spider and he spun a web
from her bright blossoms, fastened it to the
stone, bent her over, and tied her up, till she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
feared she could never get loose. But all his
nice films did her no good; her shadow
would not stay upon the stone.</p>

<p>She asked the wind to help her. The wind
swept away the spider’s web, and blew so hard
that the flower lay its whole length upon the
stone; but when the wind left her and she
rose up, there was no shadow marked upon
the stone.</p>

<p>“What is beauty worth,” thought Clara, “if
it grows by the side of a stone that does not
feel it, nor care for it?”</p>

<p>She asked the dew to help her. And the
dew said, “How can I help you! I live contentedly
in darkness, I put on my beauty only
to please others. I let the sun come through
my drops, though I know it will consume me.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were dew,” said Clara, “for then,
I, too, could do some good. Now my beauty
does no good, and I am wasting it every day
upon a stone.” When Clara breathed this
kind wish, there were glad flutters and whispers
all around.</p>

<p>The next day a beautiful child came that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
way. She was gathering ferns, and mosses,
and flowers. Whenever she saw a tuft of
moss, she would ask, “Please, dear moss, may
I take you?” And when she saw a beautiful
branch with scarlet leaves, she would ask,
“Dear bush, may I take these leaves?”</p>

<p>When she saw the beautiful columbine
growing by the side of a stone, she asked,
“Oh, sweet Columbine, may I pluck you?”
And the fairy flower said, gently, “I must not
go till my shadow is fastened upon the stone.”</p>

<p>Then the girl took from her case a pencil
and in a moment traced the shadow of the
columbine upon the stone. When she had
done this, she reached out her hand, took the
stem low down, and broke it off.</p>

<p>At that moment Clara sprang up from her
chair by the window, and there stood her
mother saying, “My dear daughter, you should
not fall asleep by an open window, not even
in summer. How damp you are! Come,
hasten to bed.”</p>

<p>It was many days before Clara could persuade
herself that she had only dreamed. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
was months before she told the dream to her
mother. And when she told it, her mother
said:</p>

<p>“Ah, Clara, would that all little girls might
dream, if only it made them as good as your
dream has made you.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_SNOWDROP">THE SNOWDROP</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hans Christian Andersen</span></p>

</div>

<p>A deep snow covered the ground for it was
winter time. The air was cold and the sharp
wind blew, but in one tiny house all was snug
and warm. There under earth and snow in
its bulb lay a little flower.</p>

<p>One day when the rain fell, little drops
trickled through the snow coverlet down into
the earth and told the flower bulb about
the light above. And presently a sunbeam,
pointed and slender, pierced its way through
the ground and tapped on the little bulb.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the flower.</p>

<p>“I cannot,” said the sunbeam. “I am not
strong enough to lift the latch. I shall be
stronger when spring comes.”</p>

<p>“When will it be spring?” asked the flower.</p>

<p>Soon many other little sunbeams tapped on
the door of the brown house and the flower
asked each of them,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“When will it be spring?”</p>

<p>But the ground was covered with snow and
every night there was ice on the water.
Spring seemed so far away that the little
flower sighed and said impatiently:</p>

<p>“How long it is! How long it is! I feel
quite cribbed and cramped. I <i>must</i> stretch
out a little. I <i>must</i> rise up; lift the latch and
look out. Then I shall say merrily to the
spring, ‘Good morning!’”</p>

<p>Now the walls of the flower’s house had
been softened by the rain, warmed by the
earth and snow and tapped upon by the sunbeams.
So when the flower within pushed
and pushed against the walls they gently gave
way. Then up from under the earth shot
the flower with a pale green bud on its tender
stalk and long slender leaves that curled
around it for a screen. The glittering snow
was very cold but easier to push through than
the solid brown earth.</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome!” sang the evening
sunbeam. “Welcome, sweet little blossom.”</p>

<p>The flower lifted its head above the snow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
into the world of light; the sunbeams cheered
it with kisses until it unfolded itself white as
the snow and decked with green stripes.</p>

<p>“Thou art a little too early,” said the
wind and the weather. “We still hold sway.
It is entirely too cold for thee.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful flower,” sang the sunbeams,
“how lovely thou art in thy white purity.
Thou art the herald of Spring,—our first
flower. Thy fair white bell shall ring the
glad tidings of Spring over towns and fields.
The snow shall melt, the bitter wind shall be
driven away. Now earth shall send forth all
her lovely blossoms and thou shalt have beautiful
fellowship. Welcome!”</p>

<p>The words of the sunbeams gave deep delight
to the flower. It bowed its head in
gladness and humility. The weather was cold
enough to freeze it to pieces—such a delicate
little flower—but it was stronger than any one
knew. It was strong in its glad faith in the
spring and the message of the sunbeams.
And so with patient hope it stood in its white
dress in the white snow, bowing its head when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the snow flakes fell and courageously lifting
it again when the sunbeams scattered the
clouds.</p>

<p>“A snowdrop,” shouted the children who
came running into the garden. “There it
stands so pretty, so beautiful—the first, the only
one. It is spring’s messenger.</p>

<p>“Spring’s messenger,” echoed from the keen
morning air.</p>

</div>

<p>Mother Earth and the little flower fairies
had been very busy indeed getting ready for
their great Spring opening. For weeks and
weeks they had been preparing all the little
flower children so that they would be ready
to respond to the call of the robin and to the
caresses of the sun and the soft west wind.</p>

<p>First of all, Snowdrop had been made
ready because she was one of the very first
to venture out into the world. And she and
her many little sisters, very prim and neat in
their white starched frocks, sat quite near the
door. Sometimes Snowdrop would not wait
for the robin and the sun to call her, but she
would slip out quietly at the first warm
shower. Nearby sat a whole row of happy
Crocuses, gay and pretty in their bell-shaped
dresses of white and purple and gold. Violets,
nestling in their soft green coats, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
there, and “Daffy-down-dilly dressed in a
green petticoat and a new gown” was quite
ready to “come to town.” Then there was
dainty Spring Beauty and the proud and flaming
Tulip and all the other dear, early flowers
that make the world so beautiful after ice
and snow are gone.</p>

<p>Yes,—every one was very busy and very
happy,—every one,—except one poor, forlorn,
little flower that sat, or rather lay, all alone
in one corner. He did not look spick and
span like the others, but his green coat hung
about him quite wilted and soiled and his
golden head drooped. He seemed very unhappy
indeed.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Dandelion,—do tell us what
has happened; you look quite crushed,” exclaimed
one of the fairies, stopping long
enough in her task of mixing colours to notice
the dejected little flower.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dandelion, do tell us,” cried Crocus
who was all ready to push his little flower face
out into the open air and who was waiting
for the first opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>“Dandelion will tell us what has happened,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
softly whispered Violet as she came closer
to what was left of poor Dandelion.</p>

<p>“Well,—since all of you seem so interested
I will tell you what happened. It certainly
took all the conceit out of me,—I still
feel weak and pale. You know that we Dandelions
are bold and venturesome folks and
some of us make our appearance in warm and
sunny places long before any of the rest of
you have the courage to come out. Indeed
it has long been a matter of pride with us to
have some person find us even before Snowdrop
makes her appearance.”</p>

<p>Snowdrop looked hurt at this, but said
nothing and Dandelion continued:</p>

<p>“And so it happened that several of us
slipped out and sprouted quietly and happily
in Farmer Brown’s front yard. It was such
a nice place,—the sun shone brightly and
coaxed us to put our best blossoms—they
were so large and yellow that I am sure
they must have looked almost as fine as Chrysanthemum.”</p>

<p>Several of the flowers cast startled looks
into the dark corner where the Chrysanthemum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
brothers and sisters were sleeping. But
their slumbers were so sound, since they would
not wake until autumn, that they did not hear
Dandelion’s boastful remark.</p>

<p>“We made a beautiful spot of yellow on
the lawn,” continued Dandelion. “Well, yesterday
Farmer and Mrs. Brown were out in
the garden and they saw us.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, see the dandelions! How early
they are this year. I shall have to call the
children.’”</p>

<p>“With that Mrs. Brown went into the house
to call her little boy and girl who came out
and greeted us joyfully.</p>

<p>“‘Let me see, Jack, if you like butter,’ said
Ruth, as she held one of my blossoms under
her brother’s chin. It surely looked quite yellow
by reflection and of course this was a
sure sign that he liked butter.</p>

<p>“‘Come, Ruth, let’s see if we can get enough
stems to make a chain for you,’ cried Jack,
and they found enough of my hollow stems
to make a chain to go around Ruth’s little
white throat.</p>

<p>“By this time I felt we were doing much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
to make the children happy and I lifted my
head proudly and whispered to my companions
that surely we were useful as well as
beautiful. Just then Mrs. Brown called the
children into the house and we were left alone
in the garden.</p>

<p>“But not for long—Alas! Farmer Brown
who had gone away while the children were
with us now returned with a strange, sharp
and shining tool in his hand. He came
straight to where we were growing so happily
and said:</p>

<p>“‘Now we’ll see whether this new weeding
knife won’t kill these pesky dandelions.
Every year they spread more and more so
that by and by there’ll not be any grass.
Perhaps by starting in early to weed them
out we can get rid of the pests!’ With that he
dug the instrument deep into the ground and
pulled up all my lovely little brothers and
sisters. I alone remained, but even I was
badly bruised as you can see, and I have
come back to tell you how cruelly I have been
treated. Wasn’t it an unkind thing? I had

make the fields and meadows glow with
the sun’s own colour.” And poor Dandelion
drooped his golden head and was as sad as
it is possible for a golden headed flower to
be.</p>

<p>All the other flower children had looked
very solemn and sympathetic during Dandelion’s
story and when he had finished, they
crowded about him.</p>

<p>“It’s just a shame,” murmured Crocus; “I
hope no one will treat me so rudely.”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” whispered Snowdrop, “it
would certainly be a painful misfortune to
have one’s roots cut to pieces by a patent
weeder,” and she shuddered so violently that
her stiff little petticoats fairly shook.</p>

<p>But Mother Earth and the fairies only
smiled and said nothing, for they knew quite
well that it would take many, many farmers
and more weeders than they could ever hope
to buy to get rid of Dandelion and his numerous
brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>And the little fairy who was Dandelion’s
particular friend laid her tiny hand on his
tousled golden head as she whispered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
“Never mind, Dandelion dear, you are the
children’s friend and companion and good old
Mother Earth will never let you perish. She
sends forth more of your kind than any other;
she has made you so sturdy and strong that
you can thrive almost anywhere—and I truly
think that she loves you best.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was a lovely day in May, and the Dandelion
family that lived near the big gate were
lifting their pretty golden heads to greet the
sun. Here and there a grandfather or grandmother
Dandelion stood crowned with silver,
and, let us whisper it softly, one or two were
quite bald, for a playful little breeze had sent
their hair a-sailing, and he chuckled at his
joke, the naughty breeze.</p>

<p>Now one grandmother stood upon a little
knoll, and so was much taller than the rest.
Indeed, she was the chief grandmother of the
family, and much respected for her wisdom.
And she was very handsome and stately, holding
her graceful silver head high above the
others.</p>

<p>“A story, a story,” coaxed her grandchildren,
turning their eager faces toward her.
Some of them were tiny buds, but they all
begged for a story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“No, children, no,” she replied, in a sweet,
grandmotherly tone. “Really, my dears, you
have had far more stories than are good for
you, and I must not let you grow up uneducated.
I think we will have a short lesson in
family history.”</p>

<p>The little Dandelions sighed.</p>

<p>“Now,” she went on, “how many of you
know why we are called Dandelions?”</p>

<p>And—will you believe it?—not one stupid
little Dandelion could answer!</p>

<p>“That is just what I expected,” said grandmother,
sternly, eyeing them over her glasses.
“My, my! this is very sad!”</p>

<p>Then one little Dandelion, prompted by his
mother, said he supposed it had something
to do with dandies, while another bright little
thing lisped out that she guessed it was because
they were as fierce as lions.</p>

<p>“No, no!” and grandmother shook her head
so briskly a silver hair went flying.</p>

<p>“Look at your leaves,” she said kindly, “and
observe the edges. Learn to notice, florets;
learn to notice.”</p>

<p>“The edges are pointed like sharp teeth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
please, grandmother,” half whispered one
bashful little fellow.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said grandmother, proceeding
learnedly; “our name is from the Latin, <i>dens
leonis</i>, meaning lion’s tooth, but our botanical
name is Taraxacum.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” sighed the little buds, for they
didn’t understand a word of it.</p>

<p>“Our roots have healing properties, and they
are employed in making medicine, while our
leaves are used in the spring for food; so we
are useful as well as ornamental.” And the
grandmother beamed with pride.</p>

<p>“But, children, you must also know that we
belong to the great and noble family of <i>Compositæ</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” gasped the little Dandelions.</p>

<p>“Now you know composite means made up
of many parts; that is, each blossom is made
up of many little florets. Study each other’s
heads and you will understand my meaning.
Now in this great family of <i>Compositæ</i> there
are many, many flowers besides the Dandelions.
In fact, my children, we have over
nine thousand relatives. Sunflowers, marigolds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
asters, goldenrod, boneset, tansy, lettuce,
and the daisy—all these belong to our family.
Not only are we many, but we have the famous
and the great among us—the thistle, royal
flower of Scotland; the cornflower of Germany;
the chrysanthemum, the emblem of
brave little Japan—all these are composite
flowers, our royal relatives.”</p>

<p>The Dandelion family wildly applauded,
and grandmother graciously bowed her acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“But, my children,” she went on, “I would
not have you forget we have also black sheep
in the family—Spanish needles, ragweed,
bitterweed, and beggar ticks; these, too, we
must own, even though we bow our heads in
shame. But so it is in all great families.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment the gardener came
whirring along with the lawn mower, and alas
and alack, not a single Dandelion was left to
tell the tale!</p>

<p>But the little winged seeds from grandmother’s
silver crown sailed away, carrying
wisdom, I doubt not, to many another Dandelion
family.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Legend</span></p>

</div>

<p>The raindrops were kept busy one morning in
the garden of the fairies. There were many
flowers to be washed clean of the dust that
had dulled their beautiful colours, and the
green of the trees must be made bright once
more; and to leave without a gambol with the
little waves of the brook was not to be thought
of. So the raindrops fell early in the morning,
but in the afternoon the sky became clear
and there was promise in the beautiful rainbow
that the raindrops’ work was done, for
that day at least.</p>

<p>“Isn’t our garden beautiful after a shower?”
said one fairy to another sitting beside her.</p>

<p>“Yes, the dust covers the colours of the
flowers almost as soon as we have painted
them. But see the gold of those daffodils!
I like the reds and blues of the other flowers,
too. They seem brighter than ever to-day.
Sometimes I sit all day and look at them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! we have a rainbow this afternoon. It
always looks to me like a great garden of flowers
stretched in bands across the sky. I like
to think that its yellow and red and blue are
made up of flowers like these in our garden
here.”</p>

<p>“Do you see that colour next to the green?
I love it; it is so dark and deep. Many times
I have wished we might have a flower on
earth just like it.”</p>

<p>“Surely you, Fairy Artist, would have no
trouble to make a colour like that; at least, it
would do no harm for you to try.”</p>

<p>The fairy artist sat with her eyes turned toward
the rainbow until it had faded from
sight, and long after the sun had sunk to rest,
she sat alone under the trees, thinking.</p>

<p>One morning she called all the fairies to
her. “Dear fairies,” she said, “I am going to
try to make a colour like that dark one in the
rainbow. It may take me a long, long while,
but one cannot give the children a greater joy
than to add a new colour to the flowers on
earth.”</p>

<p>No one knew better than she that a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
task lay before her. Many days and weeks
she tried. Sometimes the mixture was lighter
than the colour in the rainbow, and sometimes
it seemed too dark—never quite what she
wished it to be.</p>

<p>Once, as she stood before the large bowl,
mixing and stirring patiently—she stopped,
and the fairies in the garden heard a shout of
joy: “I have it! the beautiful colour! the
beautiful colour!”</p>

<p>They hurried to the place where she always
stood with her bowl and brush.</p>

<p>“See, it is the colour, indeed,” they said;
but, as they looked into the bowl, the beautiful
colour began to fade, and soon it was not
at all like the colour she had longed for.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” said the artist fairy, sadly, “it
is of no use to mix together these paints that
I have been using. We must gather my material
from all the colours of earth. My dear
fairies, you must all help.” Many were sent
far and wide to bring from the earth clays of
every colour they could find. The artist fairy
worked on faithfully and patiently.</p>

<p>One day when she had worked harder and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
longer than usual, she heard one say, “Surely,
Artist Fairy, you do not mean to work all the
evening? See, the sun is ready to sink.”</p>

<p>“Just a little longer; I feel sure that the
colour will come before sunset. Look, does
it not begin even now to change?”</p>

<p>The fairies looked into the bowl and all exclaimed
at once, “The colour at last! It is indeed
the deep colour of the rainbow!”</p>

<p>“Let us carry the bowl to the top of the
bank and at moonlight we will rejoice over
the new joy that has come to us.”</p>

<p>It was a small bank that overlooked a little
brook. Flowers had never grown there and
sometimes the fairies felt sad when they looked
upon that bare spot in their garden. Perhaps
the great tree that spread out its branches took
more than its share of the sunshine, but the
fairies loved this bank. Moonbeams always
seemed to lie so still there. “It’s just the
place for our moonlight revel!” said one.</p>

<p>All the creatures of the fairies’ garden came
to the rejoicing. The night was glorious.
The moon sent down her silvery beams earlier
than usual, although the fireflies insisted that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
there was no need of her shining so brightly,
and that she might throw all her beams to the
waves in the brook, for they looked so beautiful
with a silver covering. Not a grasshopper
went to bed, and the frog made the music for
the dance, at which the cricket felt sad, for
she knew her voice could not be heard above
his. The flowers sang their sweetest songs
about the new colour that was to come among
them. It was not late when the fairies joined
hands and danced around the bowl. Perhaps
this moonlight revel would have lasted many
hours longer, but as the fairies were finishing
the dance, one of them touched the precious
bowl and alas! the next moment they saw the
beautiful colour flow in tiny dark streams
down the hillside. For a little while it glistened
beneath the rays of the moon, and then
it sank into the dark earth. The fairies stood
and watched it, helpless.</p>

<p>“It is all lost. It is all gone in a moment,”
said the Artist Fairy, as she turned for comfort
to the rest.</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear Fairy. What you have
once done you can do again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“I do not remember how it was made. No,
I cannot get it again. It is gone forever.”</p>

<p>“Do not say that, I beg of you. Have you
not heard it said that ‘nothing is lost’?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once more the raindrops visited the garden,
and the fairies worked all day long and all
night long before everything was done.</p>

<p>“It is so refreshing when the garden has
been washed clean again of its dust.”</p>

<p>“See,” cried one. “See our bank this morning.”</p>

<p>“It is covered with a carpet of purple!
Come, let us look closer,” called another.</p>

<p>“It is the colour! It is the colour!” said
the Artist Fairy, as she hastened toward the
bank. “Nothing is lost,” she added, softly as
she looked closer. For purple violets had
been born that morning while the raindrops
fell.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_BIRDS_CAME">HOW THE BIRDS CAME</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Indian Legend</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Many years ago,” says the old Indian Grandmother,
“the Great Spirit visited the earth.
As he walked over valley and hill he said,
‘It is all beautiful and good. But the Great
Spirit loves the trees best. See how they make
the hills and valleys radiant with their green.
Earth would be fairer still,’ said the Great
Spirit, ‘if there were trees everywhere. I
would have great forests cover the mountain
sides. I would see trees as far as my eye can
reach across the land. I would have a tree
spring up wherever my foot touches the
earth!’ And it was as the Great Spirit
wished. As he wandered up and down the
mountains and valleys and across the plains,
little trees sprang up in his footsteps, until
the whole earth, like the hills and valleys, was
radiant in green. ‘The Great Spirit loves the
little trees best,’ he said, when he looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
them. ‘Little trees, I will watch over you and
guard you. I will send gentle rains that you
may have water to drink. I will send my
warm sun to shine upon you. And you must
grow and grow and grow.’ All summer long
the Great Spirit cared for them, and when the
first summer had passed and the winter came,
the little trees had grown until they spread
their branches far and wide.</p>

<p>“But one autumn day a great change came
over the radiant green. All the leaves on the
trees turned to beautiful colours—red, yellow,
brown, gold. ‘They are beautiful, beautiful,’
said the Great Spirit. ‘My trees have never
been so beautiful before.’</p>

<p>“As he spoke a gentle wind stirred the
branches and the Great Spirit saw the leaves
drop from the trees, flutter through the air and
fall to the ground.</p>

<p>“‘See,’ he exclaimed, ‘the leaves of my trees
fall to the earth where they will wither and
die. This shall not be. Behold, my leaves,
I am the Great Spirit. I will give you breath
and strength. You shall not die—you shall
live forever.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“He breathed softly upon the coloured
leaves. In a moment hundreds of leaves
moved, then fluttered, then flew away—a flock,
of beautiful birds. The red-brown oak leaves
became robins; all the yellow and gold leaves
became yellow birds. The red-maple leaves
flew away beautiful red birds, while the withered
brown leaves scattered around, sprang up
sparrows and larks.”</p>

<p>The Indian Grandmother says that is how
we got our first birds, and that is why the birds
love the trees and always live among them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">James Baldwin</span></p>

</div>

<p>There is an old story which says that the magpie
was the first bird to build a nest.</p>

<p>One day all the birds came to her and said,
“Mrs. Magpie, won’t you teach us how to
make pretty nests like your own?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the magpie, kindly. “I will
show you just how it is done.” Then she told
them to sit around her, and she would build
a nest while they were looking on. She said,
“You have only to notice what I do.”</p>

<p>She brought some mud from the side of the
brook and made it into a kind of round cake.
The birds sat very still, and watched her until
the cake was finished. Then the thrush
cried out, “Oh, I see how the nest is built!
You first make a cake of mud and then pat it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
down in the middle.” And she flew away to
try for herself; and no thrush has learned
anything about nest-building since.</p>

<p>The magpie next took some twigs, and laid
them round the cake of mud. “Say no more!”
cried the blackbird. “I understand it all.”
Away he flew to the green thickets by the
river; and that is how blackbirds build their
nests to this very day.</p>

<p>Then the magpie put a thin layer of mud
on the twigs, and smoothed it a little with her
beak. “Oh, that is all that I need to know,”
said the wise owl. “Who—who—who would
have thought it so simple a thing?” He flew
to the top of a great oak tree, where he sat for
a long time, looking at the moon and saying,
“Who—who—who!”</p>

<p>Then the magpie took some long, slender
twigs, and twined them round the outside.
“That is just the thing!” cried the song sparrow,
and off he went. And song sparrows still
make their nests by twining twigs.</p>

<p>After this, the magpie took some feathers
and fine moss, and lined the nest until it was
a very comfortable place indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“That suits me!” said the starling, and off he
flew. And everybody knows that starlings
have built well-lined nests ever since.</p>

<p>The magpie kept on working and working.
But every bird, when he had learned a little
about nest-building, flew away without waiting
to the end of the lesson. At last no one
was left but the turtledove. It had paid no
attention to what the magpie was doing, and
so had not learned anything at all.</p>

<p>It sat on a branch above the magpie’s nest,
and kept saying over and over again, “Take
two, two, two, two!” But it was looking far
away toward the blue mountains in the west,
and its thoughts were all with its dear mate
whom a cruel hawk had lately snatched away.</p>

<p>“Take two, two, two, two,” mourned the
dove. The magpie heard this just as she was
twining a slender twig around the top of her
nest. So, without looking up, she said, “One
will be enough.”</p>

<p>But the dove kept on saying, “Take two,
two, two, two.” This made the magpie
angry, and she said, “Don’t I tell you that one
will be enough?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Take two, two, two, two!” still cried the
turtledove. At last the magpie looked up and
saw that no bird was near her but the silly
dove.</p>

<p>“I’ll never give another lesson in nest building!”
she cried. And she flew away and left
the dove alone in the tree.</p>

<p>It was no use, after that, for any bird to ask
the magpie how to make a nest; and, from that
day to this, no bird has learned anything new
about its trade.</p>

<p>All the blackbirds, the thrushes, the owls,
and the doves, still build just as they did a
thousand years ago. None of them seem to
want better nests; and I doubt if any could
learn how to make them now, even though the
magpie should try to teach them again.</p>

<p>Once upon a time a mother bird and father
bird built a nest in a tree. It was made of
straw and leaves and all sorts of wonderful
things, and even had lace trimmings on it.</p>

<p>Soon after the nest was finished, the mother
bird put two eggs in it, and then she and the
father bird thought of nothing but keeping
those eggs safe and warm. Mother bird sat
on them day and night; and even when father
bird would say, “You really must fly about a
little and let me take care of the eggs,” she did
not like to leave them.</p>

<p>After a while two little birds came out of
the shells, which was just what she had been
hoping for all the time. The baby birds were
both so weak and small that they could do
nothing at all for themselves but open their
mouths very wide and call, “Peep, peep!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>mother, dear, peep!” Mother bird and father
bird were busy all day getting them something
to eat. By and by they began to grow, and
then they had soft feather clothes to wear,
which are the best clothes in the world for
baby birds.</p>

<p>Mother bird said to them one day, “You
are almost ready to learn to fly”; and then they
felt very large. That same day mother bird
and father bird flew away together to get
something for dinner; and while they were
gone the little birds heard a very queer noise
which seemed to come from a pond near the
tree. This is the way it sounded: “Kerchunk!
Kerchunk!”</p>

<p>“Oh! what can it be?” said the sister bird.
“I’ll peep over the side of the nest and see,”
said her brother. But when he put his head
out he could see nothing although he heard
the sound very plainly: “Kerchunk! Kerchunk!”
Then he leaned out a little farther
and a little farther, till his head was dizzy.
“Peep, peep! You’ll fall!” cried the sister
bird; and, sure enough, she had scarcely said
it before he tumbled out of the nest, down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
down to the ground! He was not hurt, but,
oh, how frightened he was! “Peep, peep!
mother, dear, peep!” he cried. “Peep!” cried
the sister bird up in the nest, but the mother
and father were too far away to hear their
calls.</p>

<p>The brother bird hopped about on the
ground and looked around him. He was near
the pond now, and the sound was very loud:
“Kerchunk! Kerchunk!” “Peep, peep,
peep!” called the birdie, and in a moment up
hopped a big frog. This was an old school-teacher
frog, and he had been teaching all the
little frogs to sing. “Kerchunk! Kerchunk!”
said he. “How can I teach my frogs
to sing when you are making such a noise?”</p>

<p>“Peep, peep! I want my mamma,” said the
baby bird. Then the frog saw how young the
birdie was, and he was very sorry for him.
“Come with me,” he said, “and I will teach
you to sing.” But the baby bird cried louder
than ever at this, and a mother dove, who was
singing her babies to sleep in a neighbouring
tree, flew down to see what could be the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t begin to get my children to sleep in
all this fuss,” she said to the frog, but when
she saw the little bird she was just as sorry as
the frog had been. “Poor, dear baby,” she
cried. “I will fly right off and find your
mamma for you.” So she told her children
to be good and quiet, and then away she flew.
Before long she met the father and mother,
and they all came back in a great hurry.
Then they tried to get the baby bird into the
nest again.</p>

<p>“He is entirely too young to be out of the
nest,” cried his mother, “and he must get in
again at once.” “Spread your wings and fly,
as I do,” said the father bird. So the baby
bird spread his wings and tried to fly; but, try
as he would, he could not reach the nest in the
tree.</p>

<p>“Put him into my school, and I will teach
him to swim,” said the frog; “that is better
than flying, and a great deal easier to learn, I
am sure.” This was so kind of the frog that
the mother bird thanked him; but she said she
had to be very careful with her children, and
that she was afraid the water might give the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
little bird a cold. While they were talking,
they heard somebody coming along, whistling
the jolliest tune!</p>

<p>“Dear me! Dear me!” cried the birds.
“There comes a boy!” “He’s apt to have
stones in his pocket,” said the frog. “He will
carry my darling off and put him in a cage!
Oh, fly! fly!” begged the mother bird. But
before the baby bird even had time to say,
“Peep!” the boy came in sight.</p>

<p>Then the father bird flew over the boy’s
head and the mother bird down in front of
him. The frog croaked and the dove cooed,
but none of them could hide the little bird
from him. “If you hurt him, I’ll peck your
eyes out!” cried the poor mother, who hardly
knew what she was saying; but the boy picked
the little bird up, just as if he did not hear
her. “Oh, what shall I do?” cried the mother
bird.</p>

<p>Then the boy looked at her and at the tree
where the nest was. “Coo, coo, coo! I think I
know what he is going to do,” said the dove.
“There’s no telling,” croaked the frog; and
they all watched and wondered, while the boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
put the bird in his pocket and began to climb
the tree. He swung himself from branch to
branch, climbing higher all the time, until at
last he reached the pretty nest where the sister
bird waited for her mother to come home.</p>

<p>Mother bird and father bird flew to the
top of the tree to watch the boy. “Suppose
he should take her, too,” said the mother bird.
But what do you think he did? Yes, indeed.
He put the brother bird back in the nest, as
well as the mother bird could have done it
herself.</p>

<p>“Thank you! Thank you!” sang the mother
and father as the boy scrambled down again.
“Peep, peep! Thank you!” called the little
birds from the nest. “Coo, coo! I knew,”
cried the dove. “Kerchunk! Kerchunk! I
should like to have him in my school,” said the
frog, as he hopped away to his pond.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Stewart</span></p>

</div>

<p>There was once an old apple-orchard. It
was full of beautiful things. In the spring
the trees were covered with pink and white
blossoms, while the soft green grass was
sprinkled with dandelions. In the autumn the
fruit was scarlet, and beneath the trees the
grass, which had grown high and feathery,
waved in the wind.</p>

<p>But there was something else in the orchard
which was more wonderful than the grass or
the dandelions, the blossoms or the fruit.
Sometimes early in the spring there was a sudden
flash of blue wings above the trees, then a
bird’s song, so clear and sweet and joyous that
it made us think of blue skies and of dancing
blue waves. It came from the owner of those
splendid blue wings, and we knew that the
king of the orchard had returned from his
winter’s trip, the bluebird had come home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>High up in an old tree there was a little
hole and there the bluebird made his nest.
From the outside the hole looked dark and
hard, but inside it was as soft and cosy as the
prettiest nest in the world. It was lined with
bits of feathers and down and it was quite big,
plenty big enough for the bluebird and his
wife. Her feathers were not as bright as his
nor her song as beautiful, but she could do
something even more marvellous than wearing
bright feathers or singing joyous songs. She
could lay eggs.</p>

<p>And so she laid five small, bluish eggs in
that cosy home. Then she sat on them, keeping
them warm with her soft little body, while
the father bird flashed his splendid wings back
and forth through the orchard, bringing food
to the little mother bird and singing his happy
song, happier than ever now that he could tell
of those precious eggs.</p>

<p>At last the shells went “crack,” and five
little baby birds opened their big bills very
wide and chirped for food. Then how busy
their father and mother were kept!</p>

<p>I have not time to tell you all that happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
during the summer, when the young ones
learned to fly, learned too a few notes of that
song which makes us think of the sky and the
sea. None of them were as beautiful as their
father, none of their songs were as perfect,
but their mother told them to have patience,
to try hard to fly straight, and to sing clearly,
and then, perhaps, after their winter in the
warm South, they would come back to the
orchard with wings that would flash, and with
a song that would be like the first joyous call
of the spring time.</p>

<p>And so, when the first cold weather came,
four of the young birds flew away with their
mother and father. But one was left behind!
Poor little bird, I do not know whether he had
fallen from a tree or been hit by a stone. I
only know that one wing was broken, and he
lay on the hard ground, his blue feathers dull,
his eyes dim.</p>

<p>There a little girl found him, and she lifted
him tenderly and carried him through the
orchard to the white farm house beyond. She
laid the poor little creature in a big wooden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
cage, and fed him with bread crumbs soaked
in water until his eyes grew brighter and he
tried to lift his wings. But when he found
that he could not, because one was broken,
you know, he gave a chirp of pain and huddled
down forlornly on the floor of the cage. But
soon, with all this care, he grew strong again,
even if he could not fly, and he and the little
girl had nice times together. The door of the
cage was always open and Blue-wings, that is
the name the child gave him, although his
feathers were not so very blue, would hop
down to the table and around the room, always
ending by lighting on the little girl’s
shoulder. He would eat from her hand, and
sometimes he gave little chirps which meant
“thank you.”</p>

<p>He had never sung since the day when he
had tried to raise his wings and had dropped
them in pain. Sometimes he dreamed of the
orchard, of flying swiftly through the trees and
of singing joyous songs to greet the sunshine.
Then he would open his eyes and see the cosy
kitchen and his dear little girl friend, and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
would hop down sadly and sit on her shoulder,
trying to forget his longings, trying to chirp
cheerfully when she gave him crumbs.</p>

<p>As the winter passed and the days grew
warm and bright, Blue-wings found himself
dreaming of his old free life most of the time,
and between the dreams the longing to fly and
sing was stronger than ever. One day the
window next his cage was left wide open and
through it the soft south wind brought the
fragrance of the apple blossoms, and the whir
and hum of the little creatures who were busy
greeting the spring time. Suddenly Blue-wings
felt as if he must fly and sing or his heart
would break. And then—was it a dream, he
wondered—he lifted his wings and flew right
out of the window. Through the orchard he
darted, above the blossoming trees, his blue
wings flashing in the sunshine. Even his
father’s wings were not as splendidly blue as
his, and they were so strong!</p>

<p>It was no dream now, he knew; it was all
true. And as he mounted higher and higher
he sang a song so clear and sweet and joyful
that the farmer ploughing in the field stopped,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
and listened with tears in his eyes. Blue-wing’s
song made him think of the tossing sea
he had lived beside when he was a boy. And
the little girl heard it, as she stood at the farm-house
door, and she stood smiling up into the
blue sky with thoughts of angels in her heart.</p>

<p>“Did Blue-wings ever come back to the little
girl,” you ask? He never came back to the
cage or the farm-house kitchen, but he lived
in the orchard and had a nest there. And
whenever the child saw a wonderfully blue
glimmer through the branches, or heard a most
beautiful bird’s song, she knew that Blue-wings
was near. And she remembered that
it was through her love and her care that he
had lived and grown strong, able to take his
place as king of the orchard, able by his song
to bring into people’s hearts happiness too
great for words.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_HOUSE_WREN">THE HOUSE WREN</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Neltje Blanchan</span></p>

</div>

<p>When you are sound asleep some April morning,
a tiny brown bird, just returned from a
long visit south, will probably alight on the
perch in front of one of your boxes, peep in
the doorhole, enter—although his pert little
cocked-up tail has to be lowered to let him
through—look about with approval, go out,
spring to the roof and pour out of his wee
throat a gushing torrent of music. The song
seems to bubble up faster than he can sing.
After the wren’s happy discovery of a place
to live, his song will go off in a series of
musical explosions all day long, now from the
roof, now from the clothes posts, the fence, the
barn, or the woodpile. There never was a
more tireless, spirited, brilliant singer. From
the intensity of his feelings, he sometimes
droops that expressive little tail of his, which
is usually so erect and saucy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>With characteristic energy, he frequently
begins to carry twigs into the house before he
finds a mate. The day little Jenny Wren appears
on the scene, how he does sing! Dashing
off for more twigs, but stopping to sing
to her every other minute, he helps furnish
the cottage quickly, but, of course, he overdoes—he
carries in more twigs and hay and
feathers than the little house can hold, then
pulls half of them out again. Jenny gathers,
too, for she is a bustling housewife and arranges
matters with neatness and despatch.
Neither vermin nor dust will she tolerate
within her well-kept home. Everything she
does to suit herself pleases her ardent little
lover. He applauds her with song; he flies
about after her with a nervous desire to protect;
he seems beside himself with happiness.
Let any one pass too near his best beloved, and
he begins to chatter excitedly: “<i>Chit-chit-chit-chit</i>,”
as much as to say, “Oh, do go away;
go quickly! Can’t you see how nervous and
fidgety you make me?”</p>

<p>If you fancy that Jenny Wren, who is patiently
sitting on the little pinkish, chocolate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
spotted eggs in the centre of her feather bed,
is a demure, angelic creature, you have never
seen her attack the sparrow, nearly twice her
size, that dares put his impudent head inside
her door. Oh! how she flies at him! How
she chatters and scolds! What a plucky little
shrew she is, after all! Her piercing, chattering,
scolding notes are fairly hissed into his
ears until he is thankful enough to escape.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" id="THE_LITTLE_BROWN_WREN">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s a little brown wren that has built in our tree,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she’s scarcely as big as a big bumble-bee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She has hollowed a house in the heart of a limb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And made the walls tidy and made the doors trim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the down of the crow’s foot, and tow, and with straw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cosiest dwelling that you ever saw.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The little brown wren has the brightest of eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a foot of very diminutive size.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her tail is as big as the sail of a ship.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She’s demure, though she walks with a hop and a skip;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her voice—but a flute were more fit than a pen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To tell of the voice of the little brown wren.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">One morning Sir Sparrow came sauntering by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cast on the wren’s house an envious eye;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a strut of bravado and toss of his head,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll put in my claim here,” the bold fellow said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So straightway he mounted on impudent wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And entered the door without pausing to ring.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">An instant—, and swiftly that feathery knight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All towsled and tumbled, in terror took flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While there by the door, in her favourite perch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As neat as a lady just starting for church,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With this song on her lips, “He will not call again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unless he is asked,” sat the little brown wren.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the bluebirds had her courage and hot,
quick temper, they would never let the sparrows
drive them away from their boxes. Unfortunately
a hole large enough to admit a
bluebird will easily admit those grasping monopolists;
but Jenny Wren is safe, if she did
but know it, in her house with its tiny front
door. It is amusing to see a sparrow try to
work his shoulders through the small hole of
an empty wren house, pushing and kicking
madly, but all in vain.</p>

<p>What rent do the wrens pay for their little
houses? No man is clever enough to estimate
the vast numbers of insects on your place that
they destroy. They eat nothing else, which
is the chief reason why they are so lively and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
excitable. Unable to soar after flying insects
because of their short, round wings, they keep,
as a rule, rather close to the ground which
their finely barred brown feathers so closely
match. Whether hunting for grubs in the
wood-pile, scrambling over the brush heap
after spiders, searching among the trees to
provide a dinner for their large families, or
creeping, like little feathered mice, in queer
nooks and crannies among the outbuildings
on the farm, they are always busy in your interest
which is also theirs. It certainly pays,
in every sense, to encourage the wrens.</p>

<span class="smaller">A CHRIST LEGEND</span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fiona MacLeod</span></p>

</div>

<p>It was the last month of the last year of the
seven years’ silence and peace. When would
that be, you ask?</p>

<p>Surely what other would it be than the seven
holy years when Jesus the Christ was a little
lad.</p>

<p>It was a still day. The little white flowers
that were called Breaths of Hope and that we
now call Stars of Bethlehem were so hushed in
quiet that the shadows of the moths lay on
them like the dark motionless violet in the
hearts of pansies. In the long swords of
tender grass the multitude of the daisies were
white as milk faintly stained with flusht dews
fallen from roses. On the meadows of white
poppies were long shadows blue as the blue
lagoons of the sky among drifting snow white
moors of cloud. Three white aspens on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
pastures were in a still sleep; their tremulous
leaves made no rustle; ewes and lambs were
sleeping and yearling kids opened and closed
their eyes among the garths of white clover.</p>

<p>It was Sabbath and Jesus walked alone.
When He came to a little rise in the grass He
turned and looked back at the house where His
parents dwelled. Suddenly He heard a noise
as of many birds and turned and looked beyond
the low upland where He stood. A pool
of pure water lay in the hollow, fed by a ceaseless
wellspring and round it and over it circled
birds whose breasts were grey as pearl and
whose necks shone purple and grass green and
rose. The noise was of their wings, for
though the birds were beautiful they were
voiceless and dumb as flowers.</p>

<p>At the edge of the pool stood two figures
like angels, but the child did not know them.
One He saw was beautiful as Night, and one
beautiful as Morning.</p>

<p>He drew near.</p>

<p>“I have lived seven years,” He said, “and I
wish to send peace to the far ends of the world.”</p>

<p>“Tell your secret to the birds,” said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Tell your secret to the birds,” said the
other.</p>

<p>So Jesus called the birds.</p>

<p>“Come,” He cried, and they came.</p>

<p>Seven came flying from the left, from the
side of the angel beautiful as Night. Seven
came flying from the right, from the side of
the angel beautiful as Morning.</p>

<p>To the first He said: “Look into my
heart.”</p>

<p>But they wheeled about Him, and with new
found voices mocked, crying, “How could we
see into your heart that is hidden ...” and
mocked and derided, crying, “What is Peace!
... leave us alone. Leave us alone.”</p>

<p>So Christ said to them: “I know you for
the birds of Evil. Henceforth ye shall be
black as night, and be children of the winds.”</p>

<p>To the seven other birds which circled about
Him, voiceless, and brushing their wings
against His arms, He cried:</p>

<p>“Look into my heart.”</p>

<p>And they swerved and hung before Him in
a maze of wings, and looked into His pure
heart: and, as they looked, a soft murmurous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
sound came from them—drowsy, sweet, full of
peace—and as they hung there like a breath
in frost they became white as snow.</p>

<p>“Ye are the Doves of the Spirit,” said
Christ, “and to you I will commit that which
ye have seen. Henceforth shall your plumage
be white and your voices be the voices of
peace.”</p>

<p>The young Christ turned, for He heard
Mary calling to the sheep and goats, and knew
that dayset was come and that in the valleys the
gloaming was already rising like smoke from
the urns of the twilight. When he looked
back he saw that seven white doves were in
the cedar beyond the pool, cooing in low
ecstasy of peace and awaiting through sleep
and dreams the rose-red pathways of the dawn.
Down the long grey reaches of the ebbing day
He saw seven birds rising and falling on the
wind black as black water in caves, black as
the darkness of night in old pathless woods.</p>

<p>And that is how the first doves became
white, and how the first crows became black
and were called by a name that means the clan
of darkness, the children of wind.</p>

<p>One day the flowers begged the fairies to
let them leave their stalks and fly away into
the air.</p>

<p>“We have to sit here in the same place from
morning till night, fairies! Do let us go!”</p>

<p>“Go then, dear flowers,” said the fairies.
“But you must promise that you will return to
your stalks before the sun goes down.”</p>

<p>“We promise,” called out the flowers as
they flew away, red, yellow, and white, over
the grass, out of the garden to the great wide
meadow beyond. The fairies’ garden seemed,
suddenly, to have taken wings.</p>

<p>As the sun began to set the flowers flew
quietly back to their stalks, and when the fairies
came, they found each flower again in its
place.</p>

<p>“Well done, well done!” exclaimed the fairies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
“To-morrow you may fly away again to
the meadows.”</p>

<p>As the sun rose the next morning there was
a flutter of red and yellow and white as, from
every stalk, a pair of coloured wings rose
and flapped, then took flight once more over
the meadows and fields. And by and by a
day came when the petals of the flowers became
wings—<i>real</i> wings, for the flowers
themselves had become beautiful butterflies—red,
yellow and white.</p>

<p>“Let me hire you as a nurse for my poor
children,” said a Butterfly to a quiet Caterpillar,
who was strolling along a cabbage-leaf
in her odd lumbering way. “See these
little eggs,” continued the Butterfly; “I don’t
know how long it will be before they come
to life, and I feel very sick and poorly, and if
I should die, who will take care of my baby
butterflies when I am gone? Will <i>you</i>, kind,
mild, green Caterpillar? But you must mind
what you give them to eat, Caterpillar!—they
cannot, of course, live on <i>your</i> rough
food. You must give them early dew, and
honey from the flowers; and you must let
them fly about only a little way at first; for,
of course, one can’t expect them to use their
wings properly all at once. Dear me, it is
a sad pity you cannot fly yourself! But I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
have no time to look for another nurse now,
so you will do your best, I hope. Dear, dear!
I cannot think what made me come and lay
my eggs on a cabbage-leaf! What a place for
young butterflies to be born upon! Still you
will be kind, will you not, to the poor little
ones? Here, take this gold-dust from my
wings as a reward. Oh, how dizzy I am!
Caterpillar, you will remember about the
food—”</p>

<p>And with these words the Butterfly drooped
her wings and was gone; and the green Caterpillar,
who had not had the opportunity of
even saying Yes or No to the request, was
left standing alone by the side of the Butterfly’s
eggs.</p>

<p>“A pretty nurse she has chosen, indeed, poor
lady!” exclaimed she, “and a pretty business
I have in hand! Why, her senses must have
left her, or she never would have asked a poor
crawling creature like me to bring up her
dainty little ones! Much they’ll mind me,
truly, when they feel the gay wings on their
backs, and can fly away out of my sight whenever
they choose! Ah! how silly some people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
are, in spite of their painted clothes and the
gold-dust on their wings!”</p>

<p>However, the poor Butterfly was gone, and
there lay the eggs on the cabbage-leaf; and the
green Caterpillar had a kind heart, so she resolved
to do her best. But she got no sleep
that night, she was so very anxious. She
made her back quite ache with walking all
night round her young charges, for fear any
harm should happen to them; and in the morning
says she to herself—</p>

<p>“Two heads are better than one. I will
consult some wise animal upon the matter,
and get advice. How should a poor crawling
creature like me know what to do without
asking my betters?”</p>

<p>But still there was difficulty—whom should
the Caterpillar consult? There was the
shaggy Dog who sometimes came into the garden.
But he was so rough!—he would most
likely whisk all the eggs off the cabbage-leaf
with one brush of his tail, if she called him
near to talk to her, and then she should never
forgive herself. There was the Tom Cat, to
be sure, who would sometimes sit at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
of the apple-tree, basking himself and warming
his fur in the sunshine; but he was so
selfish and indifferent!—there was no hope of
his giving himself the trouble to think about
butterflies’ eggs. “I wonder which is the
wisest of all the animals I know,” sighed the
Caterpillar, in great distress; and then she
thought, and thought, till at last she thought
of the Lark; and she fancied that because he
went up so high, and nobody knew where he
went to, he must be very clever, and know a
great deal; for to go up very high (which
she could never do) was the Caterpillar’s idea
of perfect glory.</p>

<p>Now in the neighbouring corn-field there
lived a Lark, and the Caterpillar sent a message
to him, to beg him to come and talk to
her, and when he came she told him all her
difficulties, and asked him what she was to
do to feed and rear the little creatures so different
from herself.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will be able to inquire and
hear something about it the next time you go
up high,” observed the Caterpillar, timidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>The Lark said, “Perhaps he should;” but
he did not satisfy her curiosity any further.
Soon afterwards, however, he went singing
upwards into the bright blue sky. By degrees
his voice died away in the distance till
the green Caterpillar could not hear a sound.
It is nothing to say she could not see him, for,
poor thing, she never could see far at any
time, and had a difficulty in looking upwards
at all, even when she reared herself up most
carefully, which she did now; but it was of
no use, so she dropped upon her legs again,
and resumed her walk round the Butterfly’s
eggs, nibbling a bit of the cabbage-leaf now
and then as she moved along.</p>

<p>“What a time the Lark has been gone!”
she cried, at last. “I wonder where he is
just now! I would give all my legs to know!
He must have flown up higher than usual
this time, I do think! How I should like
to know where it is that he goes to, and what
he hears in that curious blue sky! He always
sings going up and coming down, but he
never lets any secret out. He is very close!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>And the green Caterpillar took another turn
round the Butterfly’s eggs.</p>

<p>At last the Lark’s voice began to be heard
again. The Caterpillar almost jumped for
joy, and it was not long before she saw her
friend descend with hushed note to the cabbage
bed.</p>

<p>“News, news, glorious news, friend Caterpillar!”
sang the Lark; “but the worst of it
is, you won’t believe me!”</p>

<p>“I believe everything I am told,” observed
the Caterpillar, hastily.</p>

<p>“Well, then, first of all, I will tell you what
these little creatures are to eat”—and the Lark
nodded his beak towards the eggs. “What do
you think it is to be? Guess!”</p>

<p>“Dew, and the honey out of flowers, I am
afraid,” sighed the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>“No such thing! Something simpler than
that. Something <i>you</i> can get at quite easily.”</p>

<p>“I can get at nothing quite easily but the
cabbage-leaves,” murmured the Caterpillar,
in distress.</p>

<p>“Excellent! my good friend,” cried the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Lark, exultingly; “you have found it out.
You are to feed them with cabbage-leaves.”</p>

<p>“<i>Never!</i>” cried the Caterpillar, indignantly.
“It was their mother’s last request that I
should do no such thing.”</p>

<p>“Their mother knew nothing about the matter,”
persisted the Lark; “but why do you ask
me, and then disbelieve what I say? You
have neither faith nor trust.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe everything I am told,” said
the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>“Nay, but you do not,” replied the Lark;
“you won’t believe me even about the food,
and yet that is but a beginning of what I have
to tell you. Why, Caterpillar, what do you
think those little eggs will turn out to be?”</p>

<p>“Butterflies, to be sure,” said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>“<i>Caterpillars!</i>” sang the Lark; “and you’ll
find it out in time;” and the Lark flew away,
for he did not want to stay and contest the
point with his friend.</p>

<p>“I thought the Lark had been wise and
kind,” observed the mild green Caterpillar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
once more beginning to walk round the eggs,
“but I find that he is foolish and saucy instead.
Perhaps he went up <i>too</i> high this time. Ah,
it’s a pity when people who soar so high are
silly and rude nevertheless! Dear! I still
wonder whom he sees, and what he does up
yonder.”</p>

<p>“I would tell you if you would believe me,”
sang the Lark, descending once more.</p>

<p>“I believe everything I am told,” reiterated
the Caterpillar, with as grave a face as if it
were a fact.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you something else,” cried
the Lark; “for the best of my news remains
behind. <i>You will one day be a Butterfly yourself.</i>”</p>

<p>“Wretched bird!” exclaimed the Caterpillar,
“you jest with my inferiority—now you
are cruel as well as foolish. Go away! I
will ask your advice no more.”</p>

<p>“I told you you would not believe me,”
cried the Lark.</p>

<p>“I believe everything that I am told,” persisted
the Caterpillar; “that is”—and she hesitated—“everything
that is <i>reasonable</i> to believe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
But to tell me that butterflies’ eggs are
caterpillars, and that caterpillars leave off
crawling and get wings, and become butterflies!—Lark!
you are too wise to believe such
nonsense yourself, for you know it is impossible.”</p>

<p>“I know no such thing,” said the Lark,
warmly. “Whether I hover over the cornfields
of earth, or go up into the depths of the
sky, I see so many wonderful things, I know
no reason why there should not be more. Oh,
Caterpillar! it is because you crawl, because
you never get beyond your cabbage-leaf, that
you call <i>any</i> thing <i>impossible</i>.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” shouted the Caterpillar, “I
know what’s possible, and what’s not possible,
according to my experience and capacity, as
well as you do. Look at my long green body
and these endless legs, and then talk to me
about having wings and a painted feathery
coat.”</p>

<p>“You would-be-wise Caterpillar!” cried the
indignant Lark. “Do you not hear how my
song swells with rejoicing as I soar upwards
to the mysterious wonder-world above? Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Caterpillar; what comes to you from thence,
receive, as I do, upon trust.”</p>

<p>“That is what you call—”</p>

<p>“Faith,” interrupted the Lark.</p>

<p>“How am I to learn Faith?” asked the
Caterpillar.</p>

<p>At that moment she felt something at her
side. She looked round—eight or ten little
green caterpillars were moving about, and had
already made a show of a hole in the cabbage-leaf.
They had broken from the Butterfly’s
eggs!</p>

<p>Shame and amazement filled our green
friend’s heart, but joy soon followed; for, as
the first wonder was possible, the second might
be so too. “Teach me your lesson, Lark!”
she would say; and the Lark sang to her of
the wonders of the earth below and of the
heaven above. And the Caterpillar talked
all the rest of her life to her relations of the
time when she should be a Butterfly.</p>

<p>But none of them believed her. She nevertheless
had learnt the Lark’s lesson of faith,
and when she was going into her chrysalis,
she said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be a Butterfly some day!”</p>

<p>But her relations thought her head was wandering,
and they said, “Poor thing!”</p>

<p>And when she was a Butterfly, and was going
to die again, she said—</p>

<p>“I have known many wonders—I have faith—I
can trust even now for what shall come
next!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_WIND_A_HELPER">THE WIND, A HELPER</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Stewart</span></p>

</div>

<p>A little girl was once standing in a dark,
narrow street playing with some bits of
coloured paper she had found in an ash-can.
Suddenly a gust of wind came around the
street-corner. It blew the coloured scraps
right out of the child’s hand and carried them
up over her head, then higher still, over the
house-tops, until they were out of sight.</p>

<p>Janie, that was the little girl’s name,
watched them fly away, with tears in her eyes.
Her busy mother had given her this day for a
holiday, she had no toys to play with, and she
loved those gay bits of paper. As she looked
after the scraps up into the little patch of blue
sky, which was all she could see between the
high houses, she saw a small, white cloud scudding
along, just the way the papers had flown.</p>

<p>“What makes the cloud fly so fast?” thought
Janie, and as if in answer another gust of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
wind came blowing down the street. “Oh,
wind, blow me, too,” cried Janie, “take me up
in the sky with the cloud,” and she held out her
little petticoat.</p>

<p>The wind filled it and blew her—well, it
didn’t quite blow her into the sky, but it did a
kinder thing. It blew her down the dark,
narrow street, through other streets, each getting
wider and cleaner, until at last it blew
her right into the country. There she found
herself racing over green fields, with the sky
overhead so big and so blue that the clouds
looked like a flock of little sheep. There for
a moment the wind left her—he had other
things to do—and Janie stood looking around
her happy and surprised. It was a spring
day and the grass, which was waving in the
wind, was soft and green and full of buttercups
and daisies. “Far prettier than my scraps
of paper,” thought Janie. The trees were
covered with new, green leaves, some of them
were dressed in pink and white blossoms, and
their branches swayed in the wind as if they
were waving a welcome to the little girl. But
she didn’t have long to stand and look. Back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
came the wind, bringing new scents of blossoms
and other sweet spring things with him,
and off the child ran again.</p>

<p>Presently she saw in front of her a shining
blue line, and when she reached it she found
it was the sea. If any one of us has ever seen
the sea on a clear windy day we can never forget
it, and that is just the way Janie felt. The
waves were high and blue, but they wore great
white caps which broke against the wind, and
he scattered them into splendid foamy bits of
spray, while the waves came dashing over the
beach.</p>

<p>It was all so beautiful that Janie took a
long, deep breath of wind, and suddenly her
cheeks grew pink and her eyes bright, and you
never would have known she was the pale,
sad little Janie who stood in the dark street
watching her scraps of paper blow away.</p>

<p>She was standing on the beach gazing out
to sea in astonishment. For there, on the blue
water, was something which looked like a
great bird with its wings outspread, only it
was far bigger than any bird, and as it
skimmed over the water she saw men moving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
upon it. Can you guess what it was? It was
a splendid ship; but as Janie had never seen
one before, except in pictures, she was much
puzzled. “What makes it fly so fast?” she
wondered, and for an answer the wind blew
her along the beach, through a garden, and
almost into a little white cottage, where a
woman was standing with a baby in her arms.</p>

<p>She didn’t seem to mind a bit when she saw
a strange little girl come flying down the garden
path to her house. She just laughed and
cried, “This is another trick of my friend the
wind.” Then she laid the baby down in a
cradle and took both Janie’s hands, making
her sit on the door step where the wind had
dropped her.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am,” said Janie, when she could
get her breath, “can you tell me what makes
the boat sail?” The woman laughed again
and answered, “Why, this beautiful wind
blows her along, of course; that is only one of
the hundreds of things the wind does for us.
He can blow so hard that the great ships are
just driven before him, and he can blow so
softly that my baby is rocked to sleep. Look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
at the cradle now.” Janie looked, and there
in the light wind which seemed to be full of
the scent of blossoms, the cradle was rocking
so gently that the baby had fallen asleep.
Then the mother brought Janie a bowl of
bread and milk, and while she ate it they
talked about the wind.</p>

<p>“He blows away the dead leaves with such
fury,” said the mother, “that they tear along
in front of my window like a flock of frightened
birds. But when he finds a little flower
beneath the leaves he blows on its petals so
softly that it feels as if its mother were kissing
it.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, when it comes from the North,
it brings snow and hail and the beautiful frosts
of winter. But when it comes from the South
it brings sweet scents and soft, warm air. The
East Wind often brings rain and mist, and some
people don’t like it, but the ground needs the
rain, the flowers love it, and the East Wind is a
gift from God, just as the others are. The
West Wind is blowing to-day, and that is why
the world looks so fresh and shining.”</p>

<p>So they talked most of the afternoon, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
mother and Janie, until when the sun began to
sink and the ship came sailing homeward,
Janie turned again toward the city.</p>

<p>Very gently this time the wind blew her
along, beside orchards where the trees were
rustling their leaves like lullabies, and through
meadows where, like sleepy children, the flowers
were nodding their heads for good-night
to the dear West Wind.</p>

<p>And although she was leaving it all, Janie
was very happy. The woman in the cottage
by the sea had told her to come back on her
next holiday. And she knew that although
she could not always see the dancing trees and
flowers and waves and ships, she would remember
that they were waiting for her every
time she heard the wind rattling the window
or blowing among the chimneys.</p>

<p>Just before she went to sleep she looked out
of her tiny window through which a patch of
sky could be seen. It was a dark, cloudy
patch, and Janie was just turning away from
it when the clouds began to move. The wind
was still at work, in an instant the clouds had
been blown away, and through that tiny window<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Janie saw a bright, clear star shining
down upon her. “Thank you, dear wind,”
she whispered. And then, as she cuddled
down to sleep she seemed to hear the wind, or
was it the star, singing softly, “Thank God,
thank God.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_SPRINGING_TREE_WILLOWS">THE SPRINGING TREE: WILLOWS</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dyson</span></p>

</div>

<p>The willow is one of the greatest of Mother
Nature’s puzzles. It will give you years of
pleasure before you have fully found out all
its secrets. What is the puzzle? Perhaps
you say, We all know a willow. Do you?
Let us see how much you know. It is a weeping
tree; its branches and leaves drop to the
ground. That is true sometimes, not always.
It grows by the water side. Neither is that
always true. In early spring it has buds like
soft pussy-cats, which you love to gather, and
stroke against your faces, and in summer it has
long narrow leaves.</p>

<p>Yes, but if you look at all the pussy-cats you
can find, you will see that they are very different
from one another. The willow has two
kinds of tails growing on different trees. One
tree has flowers made of stamens, another tree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
has flowers containing seed-bags, and even of
these two kinds you will find many different
sorts. Then if you will look at the same trees
when the leaves come out, you will perhaps
be surprised to see that they have not all leaves
of the same sort. Some are long, narrow and
pointed, but some are broad and rounded;
some are white and silky, some are crumpled
and downy.</p>

<p>Now you see what is the great puzzle.
When you see a tree with a long narrow leaf
like a sword, you are sure at once it is a willow.
The willow gives its name to this shape; for
when we see other plants with leaves of this
pattern, we always call them willow-leaves.
The flowers of all the willows are very much
alike. They all grow on tails, true pussy-cats’
tails, so soft and silky are they. But they
are the tails of angry pussy-cats, for they stand
up straight and stiff and thick; they do not
hang down wagging and waving in a good-tempered
way. The flowers are soft silky
scales, fastened closely together on the stalk.
On the tails of one tree, under each scale,
there are two, three or five slender stamens,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
each with a double yellow head and between
these and the stem there is a little honey-bag.
Under the scales of another tree’s tails there
are beautiful silken seed-bags, shaped like
pears, the pointed end just divided into two
sticky horns. When the seeds are ripe, these
lovely silk bags split open at the point, and
the two horns curl back in a beautiful way,
like two doors opening to make way for the
crowd of tiny seeds, each one with a great
plume of whitest silk, which tries to spread
out to the sun and fresh air. The opening
seed-bags of all the willows are a charming
sight. What is all this silk for? To keep the
seeds warm? Yes, and also to float them
through the air to a place where they may
take root and grow. You must look out for
them early in the year, in late spring and early
summer, long before other seeds are ripe.
You will find that the birds are also on the
lookout,—for food you suppose? No, they
are building their nests, and they want something
nice and soft with which to line them
and make a comfortable bed for the eggs and
the little birds; and what could they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
better than this yellow silk? The thistledown
is all destroyed by the winter rains and
there is nothing else ready yet.</p>

<p>The willow is the earliest tree, except the
hazel, to say that spring is coming. It begins
to get ready in the autumn. Then the buds
swell and often burst, so that you can see the
tufts of white silk peeping out as if the flowers
were in such a hurry they could not wait
till the spring. All the winter they are growing,
but you are so busy skating and snow
balling whenever you go out that you have no
time to watch them, and are quite surprised
at the first glimpse of the soft pussy-cats in the
spring. At first only the silky scales show,
but soon after the golden heads or the funny
two-horned bottles hang out and the fruit is
ripe by the time other trees have opened their
flowers.</p>

<p>Some people say there are two hundred different
kinds of willow trees but others think
this is making too much of slight differences.
There are about fifteen kinds which are so
very different from one another that you will
easily be able to discover them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>You already know well, four kinds of willow.
Two of them are large trees; one of
these is always found by the water-side bending
over the still slow streams. It is called
the <i>white</i> willow because its leaves are covered
on both sides with soft white silk.</p>

<p>The other is the willow tree which grows
most frequently in our gardens and by the
road side. Its leaves are like those of the
white willow in shape, but on the upper side
they are bright green; with no silky covering.
This is called the <i>crack</i> willow, because its
branches crack and break at the joints so easily.
Give them just a little blow and they snap at
once. These are the only kinds of willow that
grow into large trees. They are generally
very crooked trees; their trunks split and bend
and sometimes when near a stream they stretch
over it as if they wanted to make a bridge
across.</p>

<p>The other two willows that you know well
are large shrubs or little trees not much taller
than a man. One of them bears very silky
catkins, and its leaves are always silky, quite
white on the under side. This willow has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
long, slender arms like fairies’ wands. Cinderella’s
godmother may have used one of
them. This is the osier of which we make our
baskets. If you try to break off one of these
long arms, you may tug and tug away, but all
in vain, they are so tough; and as your hand
slips there comes off into it a long roll of bark,
leaving the branch smooth and white. You
can bend these slender shoots as much as you
like and still they will not snap, and so they
are just what we want for weaving into light
baskets.</p>

<p>The other shrub or little tree is perhaps the
willow that you know best in the spring. It
grows in the hedge everywhere and is called
the <i>goat willow</i> or <i>sallow</i>. It has purplish
brown branches and from it you probably
gather your first pussy-cats. It flowers with
the snowdrop, even while it is yet winter, in
cold February or March. The first warm
sunshine is better than any fairy’s wand for
it turns these flowers into gold. Then the
bees rejoice; the food they have had in their
hives during the winter is nearly done, and
other flowers have scarcely dared to think of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
opening yet. But the bees know the secrets
of the flowers and they are quite aware of the
wee honey bag hidden in every flower of that
thick tail.</p>

<p>So you see this tree seems so full of life and
joy, it grows so fast, and is so willing and
obliging, that we call it by the name willow,
which means the “springing” tree.</p>

</div>

<p>All winter Miss Pussy had been shut up in
her house by the brook; but one bright morning
in early spring, the door of her house
opened. Then she stepped out to see the
world.</p>

<p>The swelling buds were rocking to and fro
on the branches, the grass blades were peeping
above the ground, and a few brave flowers
were opening their sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried Pussy, “the wind is sharp
and cold, if it is a bright day.”</p>

<p>“Why, whom have we here?” asked the
brook in great surprise. “True as I live, it
is Miss Pussy Willow! Good morning,
Pussy, you are out bright and early; but why
do you wear that fur hood? Summer is coming
and the days grow warmer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother Nature told me to wear it,
lest I get a toothache.”</p>

<p>Everybody was glad to see Pussy. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
little brook, the grass, the buds, and the little
spring birds. But they were all very curious
to know why she wore her fur hood.</p>

<p>Poor Pussy! she was tempted more than
once to take it off, so much was said about it.
But she didn’t; she thought best to mind
Mother Nature. Now, it grieves me to say
Mr. Robin was very bold and saucy. He
whispered some unkind things to Pussy’s
friends one day. The next morning, when
Pussy opened her eyes, the birds, the buds,
the brook, the grass, and the flowers began
to whisper to themselves: “Do you suppose
Pussy Willow has to wear her hood because
she has no hair? Poor Pussy Willow!”</p>

<p>Poor Pussy Willow! Brave Pussy felt very
sad. All she said was: “Wait and see.”</p>

<p>How surprised every one was a few days
after this! There was Pussy Willow with no
fur hood on her head, but bright golden curls
were dancing up and down in the breeze.</p>

<p>“Pussy Willow is not a baldhead; she wears
beautiful golden curls,” cried all her friends.
Mr. Robin hid his head and flew away, very
much ashamed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_DRAGON_FLY">THE DRAGON FLY</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alfred Gatty</span></p>

</div>

<p>“I wonder what becomes of the Frog when he
climbs up out of this world, and disappears so
that we do not see even his shadow; till, plop!
he is among us again. Does anybody know
where he goes to?”</p>

<p>Thus chattered the grub of a Dragon fly
as he darted about with his companions in and
out among the plants at the bottom of a beautiful
pond in the centre of a wood.</p>

<p>“Who cares what the Frog does?” answered
one who overheard the Grub’s question, “what
is it to us?”</p>

<p>“Look out for food for yourself and let
other people’s business alone,” cried another.
“But I should like to know,” said the grub.
“I can see all of you when you pass by me
among the plants in the water here, and when
I don’t see you any longer I wonder where
you have gone. I followed the Frog just
now as he went upwards, and all at once he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
went to the side of the water, then he began
to disappear and presently he was gone. Did
he leave this world? And where did he go?”</p>

<p>“You idle fellow,” cried another. “See
what a good bite you have missed with your
wonderings about nothing.” So saying he
seized an insect which was flitting right in
front of the Grub.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a heavy splash in the
water and a large yellow Frog swam down to
the bottom among the grubs.</p>

<p>“Ask the Frog himself,” suggested a minnow
as he darted by overhead.</p>

<p>Such a chance of satisfying himself was not
to be lost, and after taking two or three turns
round the roots of a water-lily, the grub
screwed up his courage and, approaching the
Frog, asked, “Is it permitted to a very unhappy
creature to speak?”</p>

<p>The Frog turned his gold edged eyes upon
him in surprise and answered, “Very unhappy
creatures had better be silent. I never talk
but when I’m happy.”</p>

<p>“But I shall be happy if I may talk,” said
the Grub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“Talk away then,” said the Frog.</p>

<p>“But it is something I want to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Ask away,” exclaimed the Frog.</p>

<p>“What is there beyond the world?” inquired
the Grub in a very quiet way.</p>

<p>“What world do you mean—this pond?”
asked the Frog, rolling his goggle eyes round
and round.</p>

<p>“I mean the place we live in whatever you
may choose to call it. I call it the world,” said
the Grub.</p>

<p>“Do you, sharp little fellow? Then what is
the place you don’t live in?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want you to tell me,”
replied the little Grub.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, little one. I shall tell you,
then. It is dry land.”</p>

<p>“Can one swim about there?” inquired the
Grub.</p>

<p>“I should think not,” chuckled the Frog.</p>

<p>“Dry land is not water. That is just what
it is <i>not</i>. Dry land is something like the
sludge at the bottom of this pond, only it is
not wet because there’s no water.”</p>

<p>“Really! What is there then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the difficulty,” exclaimed Froggy.</p>

<p>“There is something, of course, they call
it air, but how to explain it I don’t know.
Now just take my advice and ask no more
silly questions. I tell you the thing is not
worth your troubling yourself about. But I
admire your spirit,” continued the Frog. “I
will make you an offer. If you choose to take
a seat on my back I will carry you up to dry
land and you can judge for yourself what is
there and how you like it.”</p>

<p>“I accept with gratitude, honoured Frog,”
said the little Grub.</p>

<p>“Drop yourself down on my back, then, and
cling to me as well as you can. Come now,
hold fast.”</p>

<p>The little Grub obeyed and the Frog, swimming
gently upwards, soon reached the bulrushes
by the water’s side.</p>

<p>“Hold fast,” repeated the Frog, and then,
raising his head out of the pond, he clambered
up the bank and got upon the grass.</p>

<p>“Now, then, here we are,” exclaimed the
Frog. “What do you think of dry land?”</p>

<p>But no one answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“Hallow! Gone? That’s just what I was
afraid of. He has floated off my back, stupid
fellow. But perhaps he has made his way to
the water’s edge here after all, and then I can
help him out. I’ll wait about and see.”</p>

<p>And away went Froggy with a leap along
the grass by the edge of the pond glancing
every now and then among the bulrushes to
see if he could spy his little friend, the dragon
fly grub.</p>

<p>But what had become of the little grub?
He had really clung to the Frog’s back with
all his might; but the moment the mask of his
face began to issue from the water, a shock
seemed to strike his frame and he reeled from
his resting place back into the pond panting
and struggling for life.</p>

<p>“Terrible,” he cried as soon as he came to
himself. “The Frog has deceived me. He
cannot go there, at any rate.” And with these
words, the little Grub moved away to his old
companions to talk over with them what he
had done and where he had been.</p>

<p>“It was terrible, terrible. But the sun is beginning
to set and I must take a turn around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
the pond in search of food.” And away went
the little dragon fly grub for a ramble among
the water plants.</p>

<p>On his return who should he see sitting
calmly on a stone at the bottom of the pond
but his friend the yellow Frog.</p>

<p>“You here!” cried the startled Grub. “You
never left this world at all then. How you
deceived me, Frog!”</p>

<p>“Clumsy fellow,” replied the Frog. “Why
did you not sit fast as I told you?”</p>

<p>The little Grub soon told his story while
the Frog sat staring at him in silence out of
his great goggle eyes.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the Grub, “since there is
nothing beyond this world, all your stories of
going there must be mere inventions. As I
have no wish to be fooled by any more of your
tales, I will bid you a very good evening.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do no such thing,” said the Frog,
“until you have heard my story.”</p>

<p>“As you wish,” answered the Grub.</p>

<p>Then the Frog told him how he had lingered
by the edge of the pond in hope of seeing
the little Grub again, how he had hopped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
about in the grass, how he had peeped among
the bulrushes.</p>

<p>“And at last,” he continued, “though I did
not see you yourself, I saw a sight which has
more interest for you than for any other creature
that lives,” and then the Frog stopped
speaking.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked the inquisitive little
Grub.</p>

<p>“Up the polished green stalk of one of those
bulrushes I saw a little dragon-fly grub slowly
and gradually climb till he had left the water
behind him. As I continued to look, I noticed
that a rent seemed to come in your
friend’s body. I cannot tell you in what way
the thing happened, but after many struggles,
there came from it one of those beautiful creatures
who float through the air and dazzle
the eyes of all who catch glimpses of them as
they pass—a glorious Dragon-fly!</p>

<p>“As if just waking from a dream he lifted
his wings out of the covering. Though
shrivelled and damp at first they stretched and
expanded in the sunshine till they glistened
as if with fire. I saw the beautiful creature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
at last poise himself for a second or two in
the air before he took flight. I saw the four
gauzy wings flash back the sunshine that was
poured on them. I heard the clash with
which they struck the air and I saw his body
give out rays of glittering blue and green as
he darted along and away over the water in
circles that seemed to know no end. Then I
plunged below to find you out and tell you the
good news.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonderful story,” said the little
Grub.</p>

<p>“A wonderful story, indeed,” repeated the
Frog.</p>

<p>“And you really think, then, that the glorious
creature you saw was once a—”</p>

<p>“Silence,” cried the Frog. “All your questions
have been answered. It is getting dark
here in your world. I must return to my
grassy home on dry land. Go to rest, little
fellow, and awake in hopes.”</p>

<p>The Frog swam close to the bank and
clambered up its side while the little Grub returned
to his companions to wait and hope.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_CICADAS_STORY">THE CICADA’S STORY<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agnes McClellan Daulton</span></p>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time a grasshopper introduced
me to Mr. Periodical Cicada. He was a very
pleasant fellow and not a bit stuck up, although
the poets have written of him, and almost
every one knows him by the name of
seventeen year locust, though he really is not
a locust at all. I was pleased to meet him, and
asked him if he would mind telling me what
he did all those seventeen years, and he replied:</p>

<p>“Not at all, now that they are over it is very
pleasant to talk about them.” Then he began
his story. “Seventeen years ago this June, in
an old orchard, my mother tucked away in
the green twigs of a mossy apple tree hundreds
of little cradles. I was sleeping in one and
in the others were my brothers and sisters.
While my mother was at work our father sat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>on a twig close by and sang the merriest lullaby
that babies ever listened to.</p>

<p>“Several weeks later we little ones crept out
of our cradles and dropped lightly to the
ground beneath the tree; then each of us dug
a little burrow and hid ourselves away in the
warm, moist soil near sappy rootlets that gave
us our food.</p>

<p>“We were very tiny at first, but little by little
we grew, always making our cells bigger to
fit, so that we were as snug and cosy as babies
could be, only it was very dark and lonely.</p>

<p>“The rootlets would tell us when it was
spring, of how the pink and white blossoms
were holding up perfumed cups to the blue
sky; of the tree musical with the humming of
the bees that came for honey; then of summer,
when birds nested and sang among the green
boughs; later of autumn, of apples mellow
and ripe, globes of red and gold, that fell with
a muffled thud in the long, green grass; and at
last of the winter, and of the fleecy snow that
clothed the old tree in soft white. They
whispered of heat, of cold, of sunshine and
rain, of freezing winds and balmy breezes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
but we baby Cicadas neither understood nor
cared, and there tucked away in our gloomy
cells we lived seventeen long years.</p>

<p>“But one May day, in the sweetest of apple
blossoming time, all we little Cicadas made up
our minds to go out into the world and seek
our fortunes. Then every one of us began
digging and carrying up to the surface tiny
pellets of soft clay.</p>

<p>“My, but we did work hard, and by the time
the big sun had hidden his round face in the
west each of us had built a funny little chimney
six inches high.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” I cried; “and please, Mr.
Periodical Cicada, what were they for?”</p>

<p>But the Cicada only shook his head at me
gravely, as much as to say that it was a Cicada
family secret.</p>

<p>“When the chimneys were done,” he went
on, “we all scrambled up and began hunting a
safe place to rest. I soon found a fine twig
where I held on for dear life. I wasn’t very
pretty, being dressed in a brown coat, and besides,
I had gotten very muddy building my
chimney. Now while I was hanging there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
hoping to dry off—click—and goodness me!
if my little brown jacket hadn’t split down my
back from collar to waistband. I felt very
bad, for even if it was a muddy, ugly brown
coat, it was all I had, and I had no idea where
to get another in the big, cold world I had
just come into. But when I stepped out of my
coat to see if I could mend it, my stockings
and shoes came off with it and there I hung,
if you will believe me, dressed in the prettiest
cream-coloured suit you ever saw. I never
was more surprised in my life.</p>

<p>“Just then, I happened to catch a glimpse
of one of my sisters, and she also was in cream,
and there was a brother; yes, there was the
whole family, and every one of us in a lovely
suit of cream-colour. But, oh, when we got a
good look at each other we laughed till we almost
fell from our perches, for each of us had
pink eyes and heavy, fierce eyebrows, and
queer humps on the sides of our necks. Such
a ridiculous looking lot of youngsters you
never saw. Beside us hung our old, muddy
clothes, coat, shoes, stockings, and all. If you
look in the orchard you can often find these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
old clothes long after the Cicadas have flown
away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Cicada, how I should love to have
seen you!” I exclaimed. “I shall look for
little brown coats as soon as I get home.”</p>

<p>“This was only the beginning,” went on
Periodical. “The most wonderful things
were to come; for slowly, slowly those humps
on our necks began to swell, and after a time
they opened out into two lovely, gauzy wings,
veined with pearl colour. When the great
round moon came gliding up over the orchard
and shed down upon us her gentle, silvery
light, there we hung like some strange, beautiful
flowers. The apple blossoms thought we
were flowers and whispered to us some of the
prettiest honey and pollen secrets; they were
so provoked when we flew away and they
found out their mistake—but they need not
fear for we will never tell; no, indeed, never!</p>

<p>“When morning came we found our beauty
had been very fleeting, for our lovely cream-coloured
suits had changed to greenish-brown,
and our wings, though still transparent, were
dull of colour. The males among us were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
drummers. Deep within my body, I carried
two drums, each being covered by a plate that
you can easily see on the outside. Now, I
don’t need drumsticks, for my drums are air
instruments, and by twitching my muscles I
can snap my drumheads faster and faster, making
the gayest sort of a roll-call. Listen to
this: <i>Whirr-r-r-r-r!</i>”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Helen Keller</span></p>

</div>

<p>One beautiful morning last June, a sweet little
girl thought she would go out into the garden
and pick some flowers for one of her playmates,
who was sick and obliged to stay shut
up in the house this fragrant summer morning.
“Tommy shall have the most beautiful flowers
in the garden,” thought Edith, as she took her
little basket and pruning scissors, and ran out
into the garden. She looked like a lovely
fairy or a sunbeam, flitting about the rose-bushes.
I think she was the most exquisite
rose in all the garden herself. Her heart was
full of thoughts of Tommy, while she worked
away busily. “I wish I knew something that
would please Tommy more than anything
else!” she said to herself. “I would love to
make him happy,” and she sat down on the
edge of a beautiful fountain to think.</p>

<p>While she sat there thinking, two dear little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
birds began to take their bath in the lovely,
sparkling water that rippled and danced in
the sunshine. They would plunge into the
water and come out dripping, perch on the
side of the fountain for a moment, and plunge
in again. Then they would shake the bright
drops from their feathers, and fly away singing
sweeter than ever. Edith thought the
little birds enjoyed their bath as much as her
baby brother did his.</p>

<p>When they had flown away to a distant tree,
Edith noticed a beautiful pink rosebud, more
beautiful than any she had yet seen. “Oh,
how lovely you are!” she cried; and, running
to the bush where it was, she bent down the
branch, that she might examine it more closely,
when out of the heart of the rose came a small
insect and stung her pretty cheek. The little
girl began to weep loudly, and ran to her
father who was working in another part of the
yard. “Why, my little girl!” said he, “a bee
has stung you.” He drew out the sting, and
bathed her swollen cheek in cool water, at the
same time telling her many interesting things
about the wonderful little bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Do not cry any more, my child,” said her
father, “and I will take you to see a kind
gentleman who keeps many hives of bees.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” cried Edith, brushing
away her tears. “I will run and get ready
now.”</p>

<p>The bee-master, as everybody called the old
man who kept the bees, was very glad to show
his little pets, and to tell Edith all he knew
about them. He led her to a hive, made
wholly of glass, so that she might watch the
bees at their work.</p>

<p>“There are three kinds of bees in every
hive,” said the gentleman. “That large bee
in the middle is the queen bee. She is the
most important bee in the hive. She has a
sting, but seldom makes use of it. Those busy
bees are the worker bees. It was probably a
worker that stung you this morning, my little
girl,” said the bee-master.</p>

<p>Edith thought she did not like the worker
bee as well as the others; but when she heard
what industrious little workers they are, and
how they take all the care of the young bees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
build the cells of wax, and bring in the honey,
she felt much more affection for them.</p>

<p>“What do the bees do in winter when there
are no flowers from which to gather honey?”
inquired Edith.</p>

<p>“They sleep during the long, cold winter
days, and awaken when the warm spring returns,”
replied her kind instructor.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Edith’s father, “we had better
go, or you will not get to see Tommy to-day.”</p>

<p>Then the little girl thanked her new friend
for telling her so much about his interesting
pets, and promised to come and see him as
often as she could.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” cried Edith, as they walked
homeward, “I am almost glad that the naughty
little bee stung me this morning, for now I
shall have something interesting to tell
Tommy.”</p>

</div>

<p>The brook flows down past the field, around
the hill, and through the wood.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of things in the brook:
water cress and snails, and little darting fishes,
eelgrass and crawfish, and under a stone where
the water is cool and deep a little brown lizard
used to live.</p>

<p>The lizard was a busy little thing, always
anxious about something or other. She told
the crawfish when to shed their shells; she
showed the snails where to find dead leaves;
and she attended to every one else’s business
as well as her own.</p>

<p>One day when she was crawling up the
stream, she saw a tadpole lying in a sunny
shallow, with its nose almost out of the water.</p>

<p>“That tadpole oughtn’t to lie there in the
sun,” said the lizard to herself. “It’s too
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>warm. I think I’ll tell him.” So she crawled
up to where the tadpole was lying.</p>

<p>As she came nearer she heard the tadpole
whispering softly to himself. “Oh, how beautiful!
how beautiful!” he was saying.</p>

<p>“What is so beautiful?” asked the lizard
curiously, looking about her.</p>

<p>“That singing!” cried the tadpole. “Don’t
you hear it?”</p>

<p>And now that the lizard listened, she did
indeed hear a perfect chorus of birds singing
their morning songs in wood and field and
thicket.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s pretty enough,” said the lizard.
“But you oughtn’t to be lying here in the hot
sun. You’ll make yourself sick.”</p>

<p>The tadpole only wriggled impatiently, and
then lay still, listening. But presently he
turned his little dull eyes on the lizard. “I
suppose you have often seen birds coming
down to the stream to bathe,” he said. “Do
you think I look anything like one?”</p>

<p>“Like a bird!” cried the lizard. “No, you
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see why not,” said the tadpole.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
“To be sure, I haven’t any legs, but I
have a tail.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the lizard, “but birds have beaks
and feathers and wings as well, and you
haven’t anything but a body and a tail.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the tadpole, and he
sighed heavily.</p>

<p>As the lizard had said, it was warm up in
the shallow where the tadpole lay; but she was
curious now as to why the tadpole should
want to look like a bird, so she settled herself
down more comfortably and went on talking.</p>

<p>“Now, I should like to know,” she said,
“why you want to look like a bird.”</p>

<p>At first the tadpole made no answer; he
seemed to be either shy or dull, but when the
lizard asked him again, he said: “I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>Then he was silent again; and the lizard
was about to go away when the tadpole suddenly
went on: “It’s because there seems to
be something inside of me that must sing, and
I’ve tried and tried, until all the fishes and
even the snails laugh at me, and I can’t make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
sound. I think if I only had legs, and could
hop about like a bird, I could do it.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see why you should want to
sing,” said the lizard. “I never did.”</p>

<p>Still, the tadpole seemed so grieved about
it that she felt sorry for him, and stayed there
in the shallow talking to him for quite a long
time; and the next morning she went to see
him again.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a friendship between
the two; and though the lizard could
not understand why the tadpole should wish to
sing, she never made fun of him, but tried to
think of some plan by which he might learn
to do it.</p>

<p>Once she suggested that if he were only up
on the shore he might be able to do something
about it. So he wriggled himself up
half out of the water; but almost immediately
he grew so sick that the lizard had to pull him
back again by his tail, feeling terribly frightened,
all the while, lest it should break.</p>

<p>It was the very next morning that the lizard
found the tadpole in a state of wild excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
“Oh, Lizard, Lizard!” he cried, shaking
all over from his nose to his tail. “Just
look at me! I’m getting legs.”</p>

<p>It was true. There they were, still very
small and weak, but really legs. The lizard
and the tadpole had been too busy talking over
how to make them grow to notice that they
were already budding. They were still more
excited when, soon afterwards, they saw near
the front part of the tadpole’s body two more
little buds; and the lizard was sure these would
prove to be wings.</p>

<p>It was a terrible blow to them when they
found these were not wings at all, but more
legs. “Now it’s all over,” cried the tadpole,
in despair. “It was bad enough not to have
wings; but now that I’m getting legs this way,
there’s no knowing where it’ll end.”</p>

<p>The lizard, too, was almost hopeless, until
suddenly she remembered a crawfish she had
known who had lost one of his legs in a fight,
and it had hardly hurt him at all. She said
perhaps she could pull the tadpole’s front legs
off the same way.</p>

<p>He was quite willing for her to try, but at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
the first twitch she gave he cried out, “Ouch!
that hurts!” so the lizard had to stop.</p>

<p>She still thought, however, that something
could have been done about it if the tadpole
had not been such a coward and had let her
pull harder.</p>

<p>But worse was to follow.</p>

<p>One morning, before the lizard was up, the
tadpole came wriggling over to the door of
her house.</p>

<p>“Lizard, Lizard, come out here,” he cried.
Then, as soon as she came out, he begged her
to get a piece of eelgrass and measure his tail.</p>

<p>“I’ve been afraid it was shrinking for some
time,” he said, “and now I’m almost sure of
it. I have such strange feelings, too. Sometimes
I feel as though I must have air, and I
get up on a stone so that I’m almost out of the
water, and only then am I comfortable.”</p>

<p>Hastily the lizard got the eelgrass and
measured. Then they sat staring at each other
in dismay. The tail was almost gone!</p>

<p>Still, the lizard would not give up all hope.</p>

<p>That same crawfish that had lost a leg lived
farther down the stream, and he was very old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
and wise. She would get him to come and
look at the tadpole and give his advice.</p>

<p>So the kindly little lizard bustled away, and
soon she came back, to where the tadpole was
lying, and the crawfish came with her, twiddling
his feelers, and staring both ways with
his goggle eyes.</p>

<p>“Sick tadpole!” he cried. “This is no tadpole!”
Then, coming closer, the crawfish
went on: “Why are you lying here? Why
aren’t you over in the swamp singing with all
the rest of them? Don’t you know you are
a frog?”</p>

<p>“A frog!” cried the lizard.</p>

<p>But the young tadpole frog leaped clear out
of the brook with a joyous cry.</p>

<p>“A frog!” he shouted. “Why, that’s the
best of all! If that’s true I must say good-bye,
little Lizard. Hey for the wide green swamp
and the loud frog chorus under the light of the
moon! Good-bye, little friend, good-bye! I
shall never forget what you have done for me.”</p>

<p>So the frog went away to join his brothers.</p>

<p>The little lizard felt quite lonely for a while
after the frog had gone; but she comforted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
herself by thinking how happy he must be.</p>

<p>Often in the twilight, or when the moon was
bright, she listened to the chorus of frogs as
they sang over in the swamp, and wondered
if the one who sang so much louder and deeper
than the rest was the little frog who had tried
so hard to be a bird.</p>

<p>“After all,” she said to herself, “there are
more ways of singing than one.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BUZ_AND_HUM">BUZ AND HUM</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Maurice Noël</span></p>

</div>

<p>The time came when Buz and Hum, two
young bees, were allowed to try their wings.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” said a friendly older bee; “I
can spare time to fly a little way; and when I
stop, you stop, too.”</p>

<p>“All right,” cried Buz, trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>Hum said nothing, but her wings began to
move, almost in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Away went the bee, as straight as a line
from the mouth of the hive, and away flew
Buz and Hum after her; but at first starting
they both found it a little difficult to keep quite
straight, and Buz knocked against the board to
begin with, and nearly stopped herself, as she
had not learned how to rise.</p>

<p>The older bee did not go far, and lit on the
branch of a peach tree which was growing
against a wall near by. Buz came after her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
in a great hurry, but missed the branch and
gave herself a bang against the wall. Hum
saw this, and managed to stop herself in time;
but she did not judge her distance very well
either; and got on the peach tree in a scrambling
sort of way.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said their friend, as they all
three stood together; “you will soon be able
to take care of yourself now; but just let me
see you back to the hive.”</p>

<p>So off they flew again, and lighted on the
board in a very creditable manner.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the bee, “I shall leave you;
but before I go let me advise you, as a friend,
not to quit the garden to-day; there are plenty
of flowers, and plenty of opportunities for you
to meet with ‘Experience,’ without flying over
any of the four walls.”</p>

<p>“Who is Experience?” asked Buz and Hum
together.</p>

<p>“Oh! somebody to whom you are going to
be introduced, who will teach you more in a
day than you could learn from me in a week.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>So saying, she disappeared into the hive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it too delightful?” exclaimed Buz to
Hum. “Flying! why it’s even more fun that
I thought!”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Hum; “but I should like to get
some honey at once.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Buz, “only I should
like to fly a long way to get it.”</p>

<p>“I want to fill a cell quickly,” said Hum.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to be sure! What a delightful
thing it will be to put one’s proboscis down
into every flower and see what’s there! Do
you know,” added Buz, putting out her proboscis,
“I feel as if I could suck honey tremendously;
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried Hum. “I long to be at it;
let’s be off at once.”</p>

<p>So away they went and lit on a bed of flowers.
Hum spent the day between the hive and
that bed, and was quite, quite happy; but Buz,
though she, too, liked collecting the honey,
wanted to have more excitement in getting it;
and every now and then, as she passed to and
from the hive, a lovely field of clover, not far
off, sent forth such a delicious smell, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
breeze swept over it, that she was strongly
tempted to disregard the advice she had been
given, and to hurry off to it.</p>

<p>At last she could stand it no longer; and,
rising high into the air, she sailed over the
wall and went out into the world beyond.</p>

<p>And so she reached the field of clover, and,
flying quite low over the flowers, was astonished
to see how many bees were busy among
them—bumble-bees without end, and plenty
of honey-bees, too; in fact, the air was filled
with the pleasant murmur that they made.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Buz to herself, “this is
the place for me! Poor, dear old Hum! I
hope she is enjoying herself as much as I am.
I don’t mean to be idle either, so here goes for
some honey.”</p>

<p>Buz was very diligent, indeed, and soon
collected as much honey as she could carry.
But by the time she had done this she found
herself close to the farther end of the clover
field, and while resting for a moment, before
starting to carry her load to the hive, she noticed
a little pond in the corner. Feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
thirsty after her hard work, she flew off to
take a few sips; but just as she reached the
pond and was in the act of descending, a light
gust of wind caught her and turned her half
over, and before she could recover herself she
was plunged far out into the water!</p>

<p>Poor Buz! She was a brave little bee, but
this was a terrible accident; and after a few
wild struggles she almost gave herself up.
The water was so cold, and she felt herself so
helpless in it; and then the accident had happened
so suddenly, and taken her so utterly
by surprise, that it is no wonder she lost courage.
Only for a moment though; just as she
was giving up in despair the hard and seemingly
useless work of paddling and struggling
with all her poor little legs at once, she saw
that a bit of stick was floating near her, and
with renewed energy she attempted to get to
it. Alas! It was all she could do to keep
her head above water; as for moving along
through it, that seemed impossible, and she
was tempted to give up once more. It was
very hard though; there was the stick, not
more than a foot away from her. If she could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
only reach it! At any rate, she was determined
it should not be her fault if she was unsuccessful;
so she battled away harder than
ever, though her strength began to fail and
she was becoming numbed with the cold.
Just as she made this last effort another gust
of wind swept over the pond, and Buz saw that
the stick began to move through the water,
and to come nearer and nearer to her. The
fact was that a small twig sticking up from it
acted as a sail, though Buz did not know this.
And now the stick was quite close, almost
within reach; in another moment she would
be on it. Ah! but a moment seems a long
time when one is at the last gasp, as poor Buz
was.</p>

<p>Would she be drowned after all? No!
Just as she was sinking she touched the stick
with one little claw, and held on as only
drowning people can; and then she got another
claw safely lodged, and was able to rest
for a moment. Oh! the relief of <i>that</i>, after
such a long ceaseless struggle!</p>

<p>But even then it was very hard to get up on
the stick, very hard indeed. However, Buz<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
managed it at last, and dragged herself quite
out of the cold water.</p>

<p>By this time the breeze was blowing steadily
over the pond, and the stick would soon
reach the bank; but Buz felt very miserable
and cold, and her wings clung tightly to her,
and she looked dreadfully forlorn.</p>

<p>The pond, too, was overshadowed by trees
so there were no sunbeams to warm her.
“Ah,” thought she, “if I can manage to drag
myself up into the sunshine and rest and be
well warmed, I shall soon be better.”</p>

<p>Well, the bank was safely reached at last!
but Buz, all through her life, never forgot
what a business it was climbing up the side.
The long grasses yielded to her weight, and
bent almost straight down, as if on purpose to
make it as up-hill work for her as possible.
And even when she reached the top it took her
a weary while to get across the patch of dark
shadow and out into the glad sunlight beyond;
but she managed to arrive there at last, and
crawling on the top of a stone which had been
well warmed by the sun’s rays, she rested for
a long time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>At last she recovered sufficiently to make
her way, by a succession of short flights, back
to the hive. After the first of these flights
she felt so dreadfully weak that she almost
doubted being able to accomplish the journey,
and began to despond.</p>

<p>“If I ever do get home,” she said to herself,
“I will tell Hum all about it, and how right
she was to take advice.”</p>

<p>Now, whether it was the exercise that did
her good, or that the sun’s rays became hotter
that afternoon, cannot be known, but this is
certain, that Buz felt better after every flight.
When she reached the end of the clover field,
she sipped a little honey, cleaned herself with
her feet, stretched her wings, and, with the
sun glistening brightly on her, looked quite
fine again. Her last flight brought her to the
top of the kitchen-garden wall. After resting
here, she opened her wings and flew gaily to
the hive, which she entered just as if nothing
had happened.</p>

</div>

<h4>IN THE GREEN MEADOW</h4>

<p>There was once a child who lived in a little
hut, and in the hut there was nothing but a
little bed, and a looking-glass which hung in
a dark corner. Now the child cared nothing
at all about the looking-glass, but as soon as
the first sunbeam glided softly through the
casement and kissed his sweet eyelids, and the
finch and the linnet waked him merrily with
their morning songs, he arose and went out
into the green meadow. And he begged flour
of the primrose, and sugar of the violet, and
butter of the buttercup; he shook dew-drops
from the cowslip into the cup of a harebell;
spread out a large lime-leaf, set his little
breakfast upon it, and feasted daintily. Sometimes
he invited a humming bee, oftener a
gay butterfly, to partake of his feast; but his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
favourite guest was the blue dragon-fly. The
bee murmured a good deal, in a solemn tone,
about his riches; but the child thought that
if <i>he</i> were a bee, heaps of treasure would not
make him gay and happy; and that it must
be much more delightful and glorious to float
about in the free and fresh breezes of spring,
and to hum joyously in the web of the sunbeams,
than, with heavy feet and heavy heart,
to stow the silver wax and the golden honey
into cells.</p>

<p>To this the butterfly assented and he told
how, once on a time, he too had been greedy
and sordid; how he had thought of nothing
but eating, and had never once turned his eyes
upwards to the blue heavens. At length, however,
a complete change had come over him
and instead of crawling spiritless about the
dirty earth, half dreaming, he all at once
awaked as out of a deep sleep. And now he
could rise into the air and it was his greatest
joy sometimes to play with the light, and to
reflect the heavens in the bright eyes of his
wings, sometimes to listen to the soft language
of the flowers, and catch their secrets. Such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
talk delighted the child, and his breakfast was
the sweeter to him and the sunshine on leaf
and flower seemed to him more bright and
cheering.</p>

<p>But when the bee had flown off to beg from
flower to flower, and the butterfly had fluttered
away to his playfellows, the dragon-fly
still remained poised on a blade of grass.
Her slender and burnished body, more
brightly and deeply blue than the deep blue
sky, glistened in the sunbeam and her net-like
wings laughed at the flowers because <i>they</i>
could not fly, but must stand still and abide
the wind and the rain. The dragon-fly sipped
a little of the child’s clear dew-drops and
blue-violet honey, and then whispered her
winged words. And the child made an end
of his repast, closed his dark blue eyes, bent
down his beautiful head, and listened to the
sweet prattle.</p>

<p>Then the dragon-fly told much of the merry
life in the green wood,—how sometimes she
played hide-and-seek with her playfellows
under the broad leaves of the oak and the
beech trees or hunt-the-hare along the surface<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
of the still waters or sometimes quietly
watched the sunbeams, as they flew busily
from moss to flower and from flower to bush,
and shed life and warmth over all. But at
night, she said, the moonbeams glided softly
around the wood, and dropped dew into the
mouths of all the thirsty plants; and when the
dawn pelted the slumberers with the soft
roses of heaven, some of the half-drunken
flowers looked up and smiled, but most of
them could not so much as raise their heads
for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Such stories did the dragon-fly tell and as
the child sat motionless, with his eyes shut,
and his head rested on his little hand, she
thought he had fallen asleep, so poised her
double wings and flew into the rustling wood.</p>

<h4>THE STORY OF A DROP OF WATER</h4>

<p>But the child was only sunk into a dream
of delight, and was wishing <i>he</i> were a sunbeam
or a moonbeam; and he would have
been glad to hear more and more, and forever.
But at last, as all was still, he opened his eyes
and looked around for his dear guest, but she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
was flown far away; so he could not bear to
sit there any longer alone, and he rose and
went to the gurgling brook. It gushed and
rolled so merrily, and tumbled so wildly along
as it hurried to throw itself head-over-heels
into the river, just as if the great massy rock
out of which it sprang were close behind it,
and could only be escaped by a break-neck
leap.</p>

<p>Then the child began to talk to the little
waves, and asked them whence they came.
They would not stay to give him an answer,
but danced away, one over another, till at
last, that the sweet child might not be grieved,
a drop of water stopped behind a piece of
rock. From her the child heard strange histories;
but he could not understand them all,
for she told him about her former life, about
the depths of the mountain.</p>

<p>“A long while ago,” said the drop of water,
“I lived with my countless sisters in the great
ocean, in peace and unity. We had all sorts
of pastimes; sometimes we mounted up high
into the air, and peeped at the stars; then we
sank plump down deep below, and watched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
how the coral-builders work till they are tired,
that they may reach the light of day at last.
But I was conceited, and thought myself much
better than my sisters. And so one day, when
the sun rose out of the sea, I clung fast to one
of his hot beams, and thought that now I
should reach the stars, and become one of
them. But I had not ascended far, when the
sunbeam shook me off, and, in spite of all
I could say or do, let me fall into a dark cloud.
And soon a flash of fire darted through the
cloud, and now I thought I must surely die;
but the whole cloud laid itself down softly
upon the top of a mountain, and so I escaped.
Now I thought I should remain hidden, when
all on a sudden, I slipped over a round pebble,
fell from one stone to another, down into the
depths of the mountain, till at last it was pitch
dark, and I could neither see nor hear anything.
Then I found, indeed, that ‘pride
goeth before a fall,’ resigned myself to my
fate, and, as I had already laid aside all my
unhappy pride in the cloud, my portion was
now the salt of humility; and after undergoing
many purifications from the hidden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
virtues of metals and minerals, I was at length
permitted to come up once more into the free
cheerful air and now will I run back to my
sisters, and there wait patiently till I am called
to something better.”</p>

<p>But hardly had she done when the root of
a forget-me-not caught the drop of water by
her hair, and sucked her in, that she might
become a floweret, and twinkle brightly as a
blue star on the green firmament of earth.</p>

<p>There was once a little plant that grew by
a shady brook. It had many companions
even in this quiet spot. The great branches
of the old tree stretched over it, and the beautiful
flowers were friendly; but it did not seem
happy. The flowers often thought they heard
it sigh as its head drooped almost to the
ground.</p>

<p>“How I wish I might have flowers like the
other plants,” it said to itself, “blue ones,
the colour of the beautiful sky. There is so
much blue, surely some could be spared for
the earth. Then the children would not always
need to look up to see the sky.” But it
kept its secret close to its heart and only bent
its head a little lower.</p>

<p>“What makes you droop so, little plant?”
asked one of the flowers. “Your leaves are
quite down again. Surely the sun is not too
warm here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>“Tell us,” said the others, “perhaps we can
be of some help to you. We want to see you
look up again at the sky as you used to do.”</p>

<p>“It would be of no use to tell you,” answered
the little plant. “I have often whispered my
secret to the old tree as its branches swayed
near me, but it has all been of no use,” and
its head bent lower and lower.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the flowers to each other,
“perhaps our Angel can be of some help. Let
us speak to her.”</p>

<p>And when evening came, and the Angel
closed the flowers as she kissed them good-night,
she heard one whisper, “Something
makes our little friend very sad. She will
not tell us. See if she will tell you her secret.”
They saw the Angel stoop down and whisper
something to the little plant and go away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“See how our little companion has raised
its head this morning,” said the grasses.</p>

<p>“An Angel visited her last night,” one answered.</p>

<p>By and by a day came when the little plant
was covered with many tiny blossoms. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
other flowers rejoiced to see them. “We’ve
guessed your secret. What beautiful flower
children—blue, like the sky. It makes the
sky seem very near.”</p>

<p>“That is my secret,” answered the little
plant. “When I told it to the Angel I said,
‘My flowers must be just the colour of the
sky.’ And she whispered, ‘Then always look
up, for your flowers will be like that which
you love most.’ Then she went away.”</p>

<p>The Forget-me-not was happy. She never
drooped her head again, and the Angel always
kissed her good-night as she passed by.</p>

<p>“Tur-r-r-r-t, tre-t-t,” trilled a tree-toad who
was perched one June day, on a log at the
water’s edge. “This is a perfect day for us
Water-folk. Surely there never was such
blue in the sky, such green in the grass, nor
such dimpling cloud shadows skipping about
everywhere. It is the very day to sit down
and dream.”</p>

<p>“We think it just the day for a race,” cried
a whirligig beetle who was whizzing past.
“Come on, Whirligigs! let us see who will
win this time.” And away they went with
a dash, flash, and spin, a long curve here, a
quick turn there, faster and faster.</p>

<p>“My, my!” said the tree-toad, half closing
his eyes. “It seems to me every day is the
day for a race with those Whirligigs. I never
saw one of them meditating in my life. It
makes me dizzy and gives me a headache to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
watch them spinning. It is a wonder they
don’t dash themselves to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Not they,” yawned a little snapping-turtle,
who had been drowsing on a stone near by.
“If you look close at a Whirligig, you will
see that he is nearly as well protected as I am
in my strong shell. How you exist with that
soft body of yours is more than I can understand.
You are a peaceable sort of fellow,
but your best friend must admit that you are
very ugly.”</p>

<p>“No such thing,” sputtered the tree-toad,
leaning far out to look at his reflection in the
water. “I’m nothing of the sort. My mother
says that I was the handsomest polliwog in the
family. You are forced to wear one dress
always, and that a dull old shell, while I
change the colour of my clothes to suit the
occasion, as all well-bred persons should.
This morning I am wearing a full suit of
grey-brown; that is because it matches so perfectly
this lichen-covered log upon which I
am seated. When I go swimming, my bathing
suit is ashen grey, with green trimmings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
If I were to visit the swamp maples I should
don plain brown, and if I should take a hop
in the grass I should wear a beautiful dress
suit of green. I am Mr. Hyla Versicolour,
I’d have you know. See how rough and warty
my back is; that is a sign of good family
among toads. Watch me puff out my throat
like a great white bubble as I whistle my tur-r-r-r-t,
tre-t-t! Besides having a winning
voice and power to change my colour I can
breathe through my skin. I have a remarkable
foot, also. Look at this delicate webbing,
and these cunning little disks at the ends of
my toes. I can climb as well as swim, Mr.
Snapper. See me dart out my tongue; it is
fastened in front and free at the back, so that
I may catch a fly in a flash.</p>

<p>“Ugly fellow, indeed!” Mr. Hyla puffed
out his throat as far as he could. “Fiddlesticks!”
snapped the turtle, slipping into the
pool with a splash. “You are a worse boaster
than a water-boatman. Talk to yourself,
please,” and away he swam.</p>

<p>“That Snapper always was a disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
fellow,” mused Hyla, with his eyes half shut.
“There come those Whirligigs back. I wonder
which one beat.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, how could a Whirligig beat?” scornfully
asked a water-strider who had overheard
the tree-toad. “They swim in circles,
the foolish things.”</p>

<p>“That’s all you know about Whirligig racing,”
cried the largest whirligig, who was
swimming near. “We <i>all</i> win every race.
But of course you can’t expect a common
water-strider with only one pair of eyes to
understand that.”</p>

<p>“One pair of eyes!” exclaimed Hyla.
“Why, have you more eyes than the rest of
us, Mr. Whirligig?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the beetle, proudly.
“We are not given to boasting, but, since you
ask, I will say that we Whirligigs have many
remarkable traits. Our family name is Gyrinidæ.”</p>

<p>“Who cares for that?” shouted the angry
water-strider, skating toward the whirligig
with all his might. “Get out of the road,
you beetle, or I will skate you down! Ugh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
what a horrid perfume you use! How dare
you, sir!” gasped the strider, as the whirligig
swam away, leaving the poor strider
gasping and sputtering on the other side of
the pool.</p>

<p>“Keep your distance, then,” called the
whirligig after him.</p>

<p>“He won’t bother me for a time,” laughed
the beetle to the tree-toad. “You see I have
the power to give off a milky fluid from my
joints, and common water-folk object to the
odour, but it is my only way to get on with
these skaters.”</p>

<p>“But do you really mean,” asked the Hyla,
“that you have more eyes than the rest of us?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” replied the beetle with
dignity. “We Whirligigs have a second pair
of eyes under our chins, which enable us to
see to the bottom of the pool as we swim about,
and most convenient we find them.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful! wonderful!” The Hyla
could scarcely express his amazement. “I
suppose that is the reason you never hurt
yourselves in such rapid swimming?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the whirligig. “Examine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
this handsome, glittering blueblack uniform
I wear. It is really a coat of mail to
protect not only our bodies but also our gauzy
wings, for we fly as well as swim.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you could hop very
well,” remarked the tree-toad; “your legs
look like oars.”</p>

<p>“Who wants to hop if he can swim and fly?”
retorted the whirligig, with scorn. “I am
sure I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” cried the other whirligigs,
who were swimming by. “Don’t spend the
day talking when there is racing to be done.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, Mr. Tree-toad. There
comes that skater again so I will be gone,”
and off whisked the beetle.</p>

<p>“Now that was interesting,” said the Hyla
to himself. “I really ought to know something
more of my neighbours. There comes
a Water-Spider<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for a bubble. Now I must
ask her what she does with it.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mistress Spider. What
are you going to do with that silver bubble,
may I ask?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>
<p>“Good-morning,” replied Mrs. Spider, as
she snatched a bubble of air and held it with
her hind legs. “I haven’t time to explain up
here, Mr. Tree-Toad, but if you will call at
my home I will be glad to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be most happy,” replied the Hyla,
slipping into the water in a jiffy, and in a
second later he was resting on the bottom of
the pool, just under Mrs. Water Spider’s glittering
balloon.</p>

<p>“That certainly is very beautiful, Mrs.
Spider. Would you mind explaining how it
is done?” said he.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the spider, as she came
and sat in the door of her home. “My house,
sir, is woven of silk, just as are those of other
spiders, but instead of a web I weave this
egg-shaped nest with the door at the bottom.
Now, although I live under water, I breathe
air, and it is necessary for me to fill my house
with it. So up to the top I go and catch a
bubble of air with the hairs of my abdomen
and my two hinder legs. I then bring it down
here and hang it in my silken balloon until it
is, as you see, a glittering, transparent bell.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
In the top of my nest I weave a little chamber
in which to lay my eggs, and when my babies
hatch out they stay in this shining home until
they are strong enough to build a nest for
themselves.”</p>

<p>“And how many eggs, Mrs. Spider,” asked
Hyla, politely, “do you put in the chamber?”</p>

<p>“A hundred is the usual number,” replied
Mrs. Spider, “but now you really must excuse
me, as I am in need of more air.”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious,” mused the tree-toad,
looking after her as she darted toward the top.
“I should think she would feel something like
that old woman who lived in a shoe, who had
so many children she didn’t know what to do.
But what have we here?” and Mr. Hyla
leaned forward to watch a wee log hut that
was creeping in the queerest way on a water-weed.</p>

<p>“Ugh! What great goggle eyes you have!”
piped a tiny voice from the door of the hut.
“I should like to know what you are staring
at.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is surprising,” gasped the Hyla.
“Now, who in the world are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>“I am a caddis-worm out for an airing,”
said the voice again, as the hut reached the
edge of the leaf. “I hope you have no objections.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; of course not,” stammered the
astonished Hyla. “Only I should like to
know if all caddis-worms carry their houses
about with them?”</p>

<p>“This is my overcoat, I’d have you know,”
said the caddis, thrusting out his little black
head. “My brother wears one of leaves, my
sister wears a sand jacket. But mine is the
best fit.”</p>

<p>“May I ask who is your tailor?” asked the
tree-toad. “It is certainly a remarkable coat.”</p>

<p>“I am my own tailor,” replied the worm.
“A caddis would scorn to have his clothes
made for him; but it is very hard work, I can
assure you of that.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling me about it?”
inquired the Hyla. “Your coat is a perfect
fit; there isn’t a wrinkle in it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the gratified caddis-worm.
“You see,” he went on to explain, “we
always make our coats out of the material at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
hand. Now, when I found these stylish sticks
I anchored myself to a stone by a bit of silk
which I spun from my mouth, for we caddis-worms
furnish our own thread. Then by the
aid of the same silk I wove this handsome
coat, bit by bit, making one section at a time,
and then slipping my head through and wriggling
it down into place. See, I can put out
my head and my first three pairs of feet, and
so creep where I will.”</p>

<p>“Most remarkable, most remarkable,”
drawled the toad, who didn’t believe a word
of it. “And did you say your sister wears a
jacket of sand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is common enough,” answered
the caddis. “I have heard that my grandfather,
who wore an overcoat of shells, wove
into it some tiny ones, each of which was the
home of a little living creature, and the poor
things had to pick up a living the best way
they could. I have also been told that in
captivity some of my family have made remarkable
coats of gold dust and crushed glass.
After a time I shall draw my head back into
my overcoat and weave a silk veil, and so shut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
myself in and go to sleep. When I wake up
I shall no longer be a worm, but a beautiful
four-winged fly; my gauzy wings will be delicately
fringed and there will be slender antennæ
upon my head, and I shall float in the
air. Is not that a beautiful future? But here
comes a pond-snail, a most interesting fellow.
Shall I introduce you?”</p>

<p>“Most happy. I hope you are well,” said
Mr. Hyla.</p>

<p>But the snail said he wasn’t feeling very
well, as he had eaten a water-weed that didn’t
agree with him; still, he was very pleasant and
answered all the tree-toad’s questions most
kindly.</p>

<p>He said the first he could remember he was
a little baby-snail not as big as a pinhead,
moving about with hundreds of his brothers
in the sand. Yet even then he carried a house
on his back, a tiny, perfect shell, into which
he could creep when danger threatened.</p>

<p>“Some people say I am very slow,” said the
snail, “but they forget I have only one foot
and carry my house on my back. Yet I am
not complaining, for I have a head in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
are my eyes, mouth, feelers, and organs of
smell, while my relative, the oyster, having no
head, has to wear his eyes, ears, and feelers
on his mantle and his mouth near his hinge,
poor fellow! Even my own cousin, the land-snail,
has her eyes on long feelers, and has to
draw them in if danger is near. Then see
what a handsome cone-shaped shell I wear;
inside there is a kind of spiral staircase, up
which I can creep, and I can close my door
with a thin film. If I break my shell I patch
it with a sticky fluid that hardens and makes
my home as good as new. I am an air-breathing
creature and go up to the top to set
free the bubble of impure air I have breathed
and then bring down a bubble of fresh, sweet
air. I have a long, ribbon-like tongue covered
with teeth, with which I can chew the delicious
water-weeds. Really, I consider myself
a very lucky creature.”</p>

<p>“It must be a trifle monotonous,” thought
the Hyla, as he swam toward the top. “I
should want a more stirring life. I wonder
what that is!”</p>

<p>What he saw was a small object floating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
on the top of the water like an odd little boat,
only it seemed made of tiny jars with their
openings toward the bottom, and out of these
jars were darting wee brown wigglers.</p>

<p>“Hello, little chaps! who are you?” called
the tree-toad.</p>

<p>“We don’t know, we just got out,” cried
the wigglers, “but there is our big brother;
ask him.”</p>

<p>The brother was a curious fellow. His
body was very slender and of a mottled green
colour, and he had large dark eyes. He also
wore a huge moustache, which he was always
moving about in a curious way, for he used
it as a hand for feeding himself. On one side
of his tail was a queer little screw he used as
a propeller and rudder. He was sailing about
at a furious rate, but almost always on his
head, with his tail stuck out of the water.</p>

<p>“Allow me to ask what you are doing in
that strange position?” inquired the Hyla in
his mildest tones.</p>

<p>“Breathing, sir, as I should think you could
see,” replied the larva, crossly. “What other
way should one breathe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me,” said the tree-toad, as he
slipped up to his old seat on the log. “I
didn’t mean any offence.”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said the larva more pleasantly,
“I have to go into my pupa case to-morrow
and it makes me cross. It is no fun
simply to float about without eating. Still,
I shall be able to move about, and that is
more than many an insect can do as a pupa,
and after all it is only for a few days, and
then I shall hatch out into a beautiful mosquito.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the tree-toad, “that will
be pleasant. It seems to me I have heard of
the mosquito. He is a musician, like myself,
is he not?”</p>

<p>“My mother was a fine singer,” replied the
larva, proudly. “She had beautiful wings,
two plume-like antennæ, and six slender legs;
and she always carried about with her a case
in which there were five lancets to pierce the
skin of men and cattle, and she had also a
drop of poison to inject into the wound. My
father never did anything but fly about in
the sunshine and sip honey; my mother was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
the talented member of the family. I think
I will be going; there come the Giant Water-bugs.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Giant Water-bug was swimming
quietly along by her husband, who looked
very sulky and cross, and did not even return
the Hyla’s greeting.</p>

<p>“My, my,” sighed a water-boatman who
was swimming about on his back, “how I do
pity Mr. Giant Water-bug! Do not take offence
at his not speaking, Hyla; he is simply
crushed with his trouble. You see his wife
forces him to act as a sort of baby carriage.
She fastens her eggs on his back with waterproof
glue, although he struggles and struggles
to escape her, and he has to carry them about
with him everywhere, poor old fellow!
Sometimes he is so nearly heartbroken he just
hangs to a water-weed and won’t move, no
matter who tries to get up a fight with him.
It is hard on him, for Giant Water-bugs have
gay times. They fly away from the pond in
such numbers to dance about those great shining
balls that hang over the village that men
have changed their names to ‘electric-light’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
bugs. But what a time I have been gossiping
here! I think I shall go for a swim.”</p>

<p>The tree-toad sat sunning himself on the
log, but ever on the outlook for a new acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Faugh!” exclaimed the Hyla at last, “there
is one of those horrid things that used to
frighten me most out of my wits when I was
a timid little polliwog wriggling through the
water. She can’t hurt me now, so I will
speak to her. Good-morning, my friend!
May I ask who you are, and where you are
going?”</p>

<p>“I am not quite sure either,” replied the
queer-looking creature as it dragged itself
painfully up a water-weed. “I was once a
larva much feared in this pool. I fed upon
the juiciest polliwogs and other delicacies.
But a strange change came over me. I
couldn’t eat, and I fell half asleep, and to-day
I feel that I just <i>must</i> climb out of the water;
I cannot tell why. I think another change is
going to take place in me. So I can only bid
the world good-bye. Perhaps this is death.”
And fixing herself firmly to the weed by means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
of two little hooks on each of her six feet she
hung perfectly motionless.</p>

<p>“Bless me,” gasped the tree-toad, after he
had watched the creature patiently for a few
minutes. “Her eyes are certainly growing
brighter, and what is the matter with her
back? A crack, as I am a tree-toad!”</p>

<p>Slowly the queer thing drew herself out of
her case. She had a soft body now, and damp,
closely-folded wings. But the kind sunshine
and the gentle breeze came to help, and, little
by little, she began to unfurl her wonderful
wings,—great filmy wings that shimmered
with blue and green, brown and yellow, delicate
pink and violet, and she had large eyes
that glittered with twenty thousand facets.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” cried the Hyla. “How beautiful
you are, you great dragon fly!”</p>

<p>But away she flew without a word, zigzagging
back and forth across the pool; a living
gem, emerald, sapphire, and topaz, knitting
the flecked sunshine with loops of light.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the tree-toad, “this is
the most astonishing thing of all, to think
of that ugly larva changing to that beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
rainbow fly! But the day is going and I
really ought to accomplish something before
sunset. So I think I shall take a little trip
over to that elm and sing for rain,” and off
he hopped, leaving the pool sparkling in the
sunshine, dappled with cloud-shadows, cool,
silent, and sweet with drifting lilies.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, many years ago, a little
maple seed, with its two gauzy wings, became
lodged among the feathers of a wood pigeon,
and was by that swift flying bird carried far
away into the pine forest. It fell to the
ground, and the rains soon beat it into the
earth. It was not sorry to get out of sight,
for the Pine Family, into whose domain it
had been carried, seemed displeased to see it
among them. Anyway, they all looked black
and threatening to the little seed.</p>

<p>Years afterward there stood upon the spot
where the seed had fallen, a hardy tree which
we can make no mistake in calling Mr. Rock
Maple. In all that part of the forest Mr.
Maple had no relatives. As he grew stronger
and stronger, the dislike of the Pines, particularly
of the Pine boys, grew likewise stronger.
As he pushed his limbs farther in every
direction, the Pine boys seemed to look more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
darkly upon him. They begrudged him the
very ground he stood on. The younger Pine
boys spread out their arms to try to prevent
Rock Maple from getting the light and moisture
which he so much needed in that sandy
soil. At times they showered great quantities
of needles upon him, and at certain seasons
of the year they pelted him unmercifully
with their cones, sharp rough weapons that
played havoc with Mr. Maple’s garments of
green, yellow and red.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Pine, who waved his green head
in the air nearly a hundred and fifty feet above
the earth, did not seem to have very good control
over his boys, for though he himself did
not often deign to pelt Mr. Maple with the
few cones he possessed, he never rebuked the
boys for their impoliteness.</p>

<p>One day the Pine boys were unusually
rough, made so by the strong wind. They
knew Mr. Maple was not to blame, but there
was no one else to lay the blame on, so they
pelted him with cones until he lost his temper.
He was just wondering what he would do to
prevent the annoyance, when, looking down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
he saw that some little creatures had appeared
upon the scene, and were striking right and
left at the Pines with a sharp tool, against
which needles and cones were of no use whatever.</p>

<p>“How good of those little things to take
my part,” said Mr. Maple to himself.</p>

<p>In a very short time hundreds of the Pines
were lying prone upon the earth. Some were
formed into a house, while others were drawn
away to a small stream, rolled into its sluggish
waters, and soon disappeared forever from the
gaze of Mr. Pine, who grieved for them, and
of Mr. Maple, who did not.</p>

<p>“Nobody here now of any consequence,”
exclaimed Mr. Pine with a contemptuous look
at Mr. Maple. Mr. Maple paid no attention.
“If you were not such a dwarf, I’d talk to
you sometimes, even if you <i>don’t</i> amount to
much,” he finally said with an air of great
condescension. “It makes me hoarse to talk
down so far.”</p>

<p>For a long time after that Mr. Maple kept
silent, wondering why Mr. Pine and himself
had been spared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>But great surprises were in store for these
two enemies. A family came to live in the
log house, and among them was the smallest
human being that the trees had ever seen,—a
little girl named Camilla. She soon got into
the habit of coming out and playing under the
two large trees.</p>

<p>One day her father brought home a small
box, at sight of which she went into a transport
of joy, screaming, “My kit, my darling kit!
I never thought to see you again!” The box
was soon opened, and she lifted a queer-shaped
little instrument from it; then, taking it by its
long neck, she drew a small wand across it,
and it gave forth a sound that thrilled every
fibre of both Pine and Maple through and
through.</p>

<p>It is too long a story to tell how both trees
came to love Camilla very dearly; how delighted
Mr. Pine was when she took some
resin which he held out to her; how pleased
Camilla looked, how white were her teeth,
and how she loved him for the gift; how Mr.
Maple had his reward when the passing frost
touched him and gave him a beautiful garment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
much to the delight of Little Camilla,
or how when the long winter was nearly done
the little violinist fairly hugged him for the
sugar he had yielded her.</p>

<p>A fatal day came at last. Men appeared
with sharp axes and heavy wagons and attacked
Mr. Maple. They had not cut into
him very deeply before one of them exclaimed
to the others, “Curly Maple, as I live!”</p>

<p>Mr. Pine laughed, but before night he had
met the same fate. The man who felled him
remarked to the others, “Well on to ten thousand
feet in that old fellow!”</p>

<p>Camilla looked on while the trees were
loaded and drawn away, tears filling her blue
eyes. “Good-bye, old friends,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Away to a noisy place they went. Soon
they were cut up into small strips by a monster
with very sharp teeth. These strips were carried
in different directions, some of the best
pieces being loaded upon cars and hurried
away to a distant city. From this place they
took a long journey in the deep, dark hold of
a great ship; again upon the cars, until at
last they rested in a dry house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>One day one of the Maple boards and one
of the Pine boards were taken out, carefully
inspected and then made smooth and even on
the outside. Then a skilful workman cut
them up into small pieces, and made them into
curious shapes. He took great pains not to
leave the scratch of knife or chisel upon any
of the pieces. He finally glued them all together,
and behold, they were of the same
shape as Camilla’s kit, but somewhat larger.</p>

<p>The workman explained to an observer, “I
use pine for the front, or sounding-board, as
it is light and vibrant. The more porous it
is the better. Maple is the best wood I can
get for the other parts, because it is so dense,
vibrates slowly, and holds the vibrations made
by the pine for a long time, thus prolonging
the sound.”</p>

<p>After the slow process of finishing and varnishing
was completed the violin was placed
in a dark box, and there it lay for a long time.</p>

<p>Pine and Maple said little to each other.
They were not very comfortable nor very
happy. The strings that had been stretched
over them were very cruel and pressed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
the Pine, which pressed upon the soundpost,
and that pressed upon the Maple. Sometimes
a string broke, and gave them temporary relief,
but soon some one would come and put
on another.</p>

<p>After passing through two or three small
stores the violin finally came to rest in a large
one, in a city distant from the one in which
it had been made, and all was quiet for a
long time. Still Pine and Maple said but
little to each other. Shut up in their dark
box they didn’t feel very cheerful.</p>

<p>“A living death, this!” grumbled Pine.</p>

<p>“We must make the best of it,” replied
Maple.</p>

<p>One evening a stranger came into the store
and asked, “Have you a first-class violin in
stock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just one. I got it several months ago
by the merest chance. We don’t keep such
instruments usually,” said the dealer, taking
out the violin. “It is wonderful for an instrument
not ten years old.”</p>

<p>“I want one for the evening, only,” said the
stranger. “Madame Camilla is here in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
city, and to-night plays for the Orphans’
Home. One of her violins is under treatment,
and her Cremona has been broken.”</p>

<p>“Madame Camilla!” exclaimed Pine, with
a quiver of delight.</p>

<p>“Can it be our little Camilla?” asked Maple
in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the violin was taken from
its case by Camilla’s own hand. She ran her
fingers gently over the strings, looked at the
varnish, tightened the bow and rosined it
carefully and finally placed the violin against
her shoulder, and drew the bow smoothly
across the strings.</p>

<p>She played an air in which the coming of
a storm was represented, and Pine and Maple
heard once more the sighing of the wind as
it once had swept through their branches.</p>

<p>“That’s the sound of the wind in the pine
and maple that stood near my log cabin home
when I was a little girl,” said the musician to
the people standing near.</p>

<p>Then for the first time both Pine and Maple
felt certain that this was really their Camilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>The curtain rose, the manager stepped to
the front and in a few words explained the
accident, and stated that a new and untried
violin must be used.</p>

<p>“Let us lay aside all discord, and act in
perfect harmony to-night,” said the forgiving
Maple.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” answered Pine, more cheerfully
than he had ever spoken before.</p>

<p>Pine and Maple beat and throbbed under
the wonderful strokes and long-drawn sweeps
of the bow. When the piece was finished a
storm of applause burst upon them like a
tempest. Again the curtain went up and the
violin found itself in the glare of the footlights
once more. This time the performer
touched the strings gently, and played a tune
that many people who had come to the store
had tried to play, the words to the first line
being, “Way down upon de Suwanee Ribber.”</p>

<p>When it was finished the people were silent,
and tears glistened in many eyes.</p>

<p>“Maple, forgive me,” said the now humble
Pine. “I’ve learned a great lesson, though a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
very simple one. The best results in life
are accomplished through harmony and not
through discord.”</p>

<p>“We’ll live in harmony hereafter,” said
Maple.</p>

<p>The great soul of the artist had breathed
into the instrument and made it glorious.</p>

<p>Shrill and sharp North Wind whistled
through the forest where the trees and flowers
were patiently awaiting the arrival of My
Lady Spring. Jack Frost was delighted.
Perched on the topmost branches of the great
trees he laughed gleefully. “Ha! ha! ha!
surely Old Father Winter has forgotten that
April is almost here,” said he. “I shall not
remind him, not I. They say My Lady
Spring who is waiting in Wild-Flower Hollow
is growing most impatient!”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” whispered Mother Maple
to her neighbour Dame Oak. “I’ve told my
babies many pleasant stories about My Lady
Spring and her companion Merry Sunshine.
I’m afraid I shall be unable to keep them in
their dark cradles much longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh! do hold them back a few days,” said
Dame Oak. “You remember what trouble
that rude rollicking fellow Jack-Frost made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
last year. So long as he is here he insists on
playing with all the babies of the forest. I
do wish Lady Spring would come and tell
him to be off.”</p>

<p>“He’ll never go so long as his bold brother
North Wind remains,” sighed Silver Beech.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Dame Oak. “I feel
sure we shall not have to wait much longer.
Indeed I saw Merry Sunshine dancing near
the edge of the forest yesterday. I feel quite
hopeful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how happy I shall be to hear Thrush’s
song again,” said Silver Beech.</p>

<p>“And the happy children’s voices! They
haven’t been to the forest since nutting season,”
said Dame Oak. “I’m sure they are longing
to come again.”</p>

<p>For some time Lady Spring had been waiting
in Wild-Flower Hollow near the edge of
the forest. Only a few days ago the children
had come there to gather flowers.</p>

<p>“Not a bird or blossom anywhere. See
how brown and bare that bank is!” said one.</p>

<p>“And Easter is almost here. I wonder why
Lady Spring is so late!” said another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe she has forgotten us,” said a tiny
companion.</p>

<p>“I am very disappointed. Last year at this
time that bank was blue with violets. Come,
let us go home!” And away ran the children.</p>

<p>“I shall wait no longer,” said Lady Spring.
“Come, Merry Sunshine.”</p>

<p>Away danced Merry Sunshine and Lady
Spring followed in trailing robes of green and
white.</p>

<p>Waving her silver wand over the bank of
Wild-Flower Hollow she whispered, “Ready,
Violets; come, Starry Bluet; my sweet Anemone,
you need wait no longer. Ah, brave
Arbutus, I see you were expecting me. Did
you think I was never coming, my dainty
Spring Beauty?”</p>

<p>How graceful Lady Spring looked waving
her magic wand here and there through the
forest. Wherever she stooped and touched
the brown earth the fresh grass leaped forth;
when she tapped the great tree trunks the bare
branches above instantly veiled themselves in
tender green. She waved at the brooklet and
away it ran over the moss and pebbles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“Sing, Merry Sunshine, dance and sing!”
Lady Spring called to her companion.</p>

<p>Merry Sunshine trilled the gayest song. It
rang sweetly through forest and echoed far
away over the hills to the South where the
birds were waiting patiently for the call.
How gladly they came! Bluebird and Bobolink,
Cardinal and Chickadee, Blackbird and
Thrush and Wren,—all the forest warblers answered
Merry Sunshine’s Song of Spring.</p>

<p>“At last my work is done!” said Lady Spring
joyously.</p>

<p>“When are the children coming?” asked
Dame Oak.</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure! I must not forget to send
them word that I am here. Robin Redbreast,
will you take a message of Spring to the children?
I’m sure they will want to see the
lovely blossoms and hear the sweet birds’
songs.”</p>

<p>“Lady Spring,” said Robin, “I’m afraid I
cannot go to-day. You see my mate and I are
building a soft warm nest in Oak-Tree. We
are very late this year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>“To be sure, Robin. I wonder where I can
find a messenger.”</p>

<p>“I think Red Fox would go for you,” answered
Robin Redbreast. “See, here he
comes now.”</p>

<p>“Will you take word to the children that
I have come, Reynard?” asked Lady Spring.</p>

<p>“Oh, I should be glad to go, but the people
might think I came to steal their chickens. I
believe Black Bear would be a better messenger
than any of us. I’ll run and ask him
to go.”</p>

<p>But Reynard brought back the answer that
Black Bear was afraid he would frighten the
children too much.</p>

<p>“What shall I do for a messenger,” sighed
Lady Spring.</p>

<p>Robin cocked his head on one side and
looked very thoughtful. Then he said, “I
have it, I believe Bunny Rabbit would go; I
saw him hop past but a moment ago. I’ll call
him.”</p>

<p>At Robin’s whistle Bunny came leaping out
of the bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>“Bunny Rabbit, I want you to take a message
to the children in the city. Please go
and tell them Spring has come.”</p>

<p>“A message to the city, Lady Spring!”
exclaimed Bunny, raising his ears upright.
“Please ask me to do anything but that! Dear
me! The dogs might catch me! They bark
so fiercely! And naughty boys might chase
me! I’m sure I should never come back!”
Bunny dropped his voice and looked quickly
about in all directions. Lady Spring was
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Bunny,” said Robin, “couldn’t you go at
night? You know the dogs and boys go to
sleep then and you can hop so softly that I’m
sure they would not hear you. Besides, your
ears are very sharp.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I could go at midnight,”
said Bunny, thoughtfully. “But how could I
take a message to the children without wakening
them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can manage that,” said Lady Spring.
“Meet me in Wild-Flower Hollow a little before
twelve o’clock. Then you shall know all
about my plan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“I will come,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>Lady Spring made a beautiful basket out of
twigs and leaves and grasses. She lined it
with the softest moss. Around the top she
placed a garland of choicest wild flowers.
And, when the birds knew that she was sending
a message to the children, each one wished
to help her. So they sent lovely little eggs
of all colours—greenish blue, brown, white
and spotted. How beautiful they looked lying
on the bed of moss wreathed with flowers.</p>

<p>A little before midnight Bunny came to
Wild-Flower Hollow.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” said Lady Spring. “See,
Bunny, here is plenty of moss. Do be careful
with these precious eggs. When you come
to a house where a little child lives take out
a bit of moss and form it into a wee nest like
this,” said Lady Spring, weaving quickly a
moss nest. “Then put into each one a wild
flower and an egg,—so. Leave an egg for
each child in the house.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I understand, Lady Spring,” said
Bunny. “How pretty the nest is!”</p>

<p>Off he started as gaily as could be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>On Easter morning Merry Sunshine wakened
the children early.</p>

<p>“See! see! I found this little moss nest on
the door-step,” cried one of them. “There is
a wild-flower and three coloured eggs in it.
How beautiful!”</p>

<p>“An egg for each of us!” said another. “I
wonder what it means.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” said little brother.
“There are Bunny tracks on the path. He
must have brought the nest to us. Perhaps
he came to tell us Spring is here.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did!” cried the children, clapping
their tiny hands in glee. “Bunny was
Spring’s messenger.”</p>

<p>Away to the woods ran the children, crying
out, “Spring is here, Spring is here.
Bunny Rabbit brought us the message.”</p>

<p>There came once a little Elf Boy to live on
this earth, and he was so much pleased with
it that he stayed, never caring to go back to
his own world. I do not know where his own
world was, or just how he came to leave it.
Some thought that he was dropped by accident
from some falling star, and some that
he had flown away, thinking that he could
fly back again whenever he chose, because he
did not know that children always lose their
wings when they come into this world. But
no one knew certainly, as he never told any
one; and, after all, it did not matter, since,
as I have already said, he liked the earth so
much that he did not care to leave it.</p>

<p>There was a Hermit who lived in the valley
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>where the little Boy had first come, and, as he
had a room in his house for a visitor, he took
him in, and they grew to like each other so
well that again the little Boy did not care to
go away, nor did the Hermit care to have him.
The Hermit had not always been a Hermit,
but he had become a sorrowful man, and did
not care to live where other people lived, or to
share any of their pleasures. The reason he
had become a sorrowful man was that his only
child had died, and it seemed to him that there
was nothing worth living for after that. So
he moved to the lonely valley, and I suppose
would have spent the rest of his life by himself,
if it had not been for the little Elf Boy.</p>

<p>It was a very lovely valley, with great, green
meadows that sloped down to a rippling brook,
and in summer-time were full of red and white
and yellow blossoms. Over the brook there
hung green trees, whose roots made pleasant
places to rest when one was tired; and along
the water’s edge there grew blue flowers,
while many little frogs and other live creatures
played there. It was summer-time when the
little Elf Boy came, and the flowers and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
trees and the brook and the frogs made him
very happy. I think that in the world from
which he came they did not have such things:
it was made chiefly of gold and silver and
precious stones, instead of things that grow and
blossom and keep one company. So the Elf
Boy was very happy. He did not ask to go to
play in the village over the hill, but was quite
content with the meadows and the brook-side.
The only thing that did not please him was
that the old Hermit still remained sorrowful,
thinking always of his child who had died
and this the Elf Boy did not understand, for
in the world from which he came nothing ever
died, and he thought it strange that if the
Hermit’s child had died he did not patiently
wait for him to come back again.</p>

<p>So the summer went merrily on, and the
Elf Boy learned to know the names of all the
flowers in the meadow, and to love them
dearly. He also became so well acquainted
with the birds that they would come to him
for crumbs, and sit on the branches close by
to sing to him; the frogs would do the same
thing, and although the Elf Boy did not think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
their voices as sweet as those of the birds, he
was too polite to let them know it.</p>

<p>But when September came, there began to
be a sad change. The first thing the Elf Boy
noticed was that the birds began to disappear
from the meadows. When he complained of
this, the Hermit told him they had gone to
make their visit to the Southland, and would
come back again; and this he easily believed.
But as time went on, and the air became more
and more still as the last of them took their
flight, he began to lose heart.</p>

<p>What was worse, at the same time the flowers
began to disappear from the meadows.
They were dead, the Hermit said, and in this
way the Elf Boy learned what that meant. At
first others came to take their places, and he
tried to learn to like the flowers of autumn as
well as those which he had known first. But
as these faded and dropped off, none came
after them. The mornings grew colder, and
the leaves on the trees were changing in a
strange way. When they grew red and yellow,
instead of green, the Elf Boy thought it
was a queer thing for them to put on different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
colours, and wondered how long it would last.
But when they began to fall, he was very sad
indeed. At last there came a day when every
limb was bare, except for a few dried leaves
at the top of one of the tallest trees. The Elf
Boy was almost broken-hearted.</p>

<p>One morning he went out early to see what
new and dreadful thing had happened in the
night, for it seemed now that every night took
something beautiful out of the world. He
made his way toward the brook, but when he
reached the place where he usually heard it
calling to him as it ran merrily over the stones,
he could not hear a sound. He stopped and
listened, but everything was wonderfully still.
Then he ran as fast as his feet would carry him
to the border of the brook. Sure enough, it
had stopped running. It was covered with a
hard sheet of ice.</p>

<p>The Elf Boy turned and went to the Hermit’s
house. By the time he had reached it,
the tears were running down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter?” asked the Hermit.</p>

<p>“The brook is dead,” said the Elf Boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>“I think not,” said the Hermit. “It is
frozen over, but that will not hurt it. Be
patient, and it will sing to you again.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Elf Boy. “You told me that
the birds would come back, and they have not
come. You told me that the trees were not
dead, but their leaves have every one gone,
and I am sure they are. You told me that the
flowers had seeds that did not die, but would
make other flowers but I can not find them,
and the meadow is bare and dark. Even the
grass is not green any more. It is a dead
world. In the summer-time I did not see how
you could be sorrowful; but now I do not see
how any one can be happy.”</p>

<p>The Hermit thought it would be of no use
to try to explain anything more to the Elf
Boy, so he said again, “Be patient,” and tried
to find some books in which he could teach the
Boy to read, and make him forget the outside
world.</p>

<p>The next time they went for a walk to the
village over the hill, the Elf Boy was very
curious to see whether the same thing had
happened there that had happened in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
valley. Of course it had: the trees there
seemed dead, too, and the flowers were all
gone from the door-yards. The Boy expected
that every one in the village would now be as
sorrowful as the Hermit, and he was very
much surprised when he saw them looking
as cheerful as ever. There were some boys
playing on the street-corner, who seemed to
be as happy as boys could be. One of them
spoke to the Elf Boy, and he answered:</p>

<p>“How can you play so happily, when such
a dreadful thing has happened to the world?”</p>

<p>“Why, what has happened?”</p>

<p>“The flowers and trees are dead,” said the
Elf Boy, “the birds are gone, and the brook
is frozen, and the meadow is bare and grey.
And it is so on this side of the hill also.”</p>

<p>Then the boys in the street laughed merrily,
and did not answer the Elf Boy, for they remembered
that he was a stranger in the world,
and supposed he would not understand if they
should try to talk to him. And he went on
through the village, not daring to speak to any
others, but all the time wondering that the
people could still be so happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>As the winter came on, the Hermit taught
him many things from the books in his house,
and the Elf Boy grew interested in them and
was not always sad. When the snow came he
found ways to play in it, and even saw that
the meadow was beautiful again, though in a
different way from what it had been in summer.
Yet still he could not think the world
by any means so pleasant a place as it had been
in the time of flowers and birds; and if it were
not that he had become very fond of the Hermit,
who was now the only friend he could
remember, he would have wished to go back
to the world from which he had come. It
seemed to him now that the Hermit must miss
him very much if he should go away, since
they two were the only people who seemed
really to understand how sorrowful a place the
earth is.</p>

<p>So the weeks went by. One day in March,
as he and the Hermit sat at their books, drops
of water began to fall from the eaves of the
roof, and they saw that the snow was melting
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Do you want to take a little walk down toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
the brook?” asked the Hermit. “I
should not wonder if I could prove to you
to-day that it has not forgotten how to talk to
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Elf Boy, though he did not
think the Hermit could be right. It was
months since he had cared to visit the brook,
it made him so sad to find it still and cold.</p>

<p>When they reached the foot of the hillside
the sheet of ice was still there, as he had expected.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the Hermit. “Come
out on the ice with me, and put down your ear
and listen.”</p>

<p>So the Elf Boy put down his ear and
listened; and he heard, as plainly as though
there were no ice between, the voice of the
brook gurgling in the bottom of its bed. He
clapped his hands for joy.</p>

<p>“It is waking up, you see,” said the Hermit.
“Other things will waken too, if you will be
patient.”</p>

<p>The Elf Boy did not know quite what to
think, but he waited day after day with his
eyes and ears wide open to see if anything else<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
might happen; and wonderful things did happen
all the time. The brook sang more and
more distinctly, and at last broke through its
cold coverlet and went dancing along in full
sight. One morning, while the snow was still
around the house, the Elf Boy heard a chirping
sound, and looking from his window, saw
a red robin outside asking for his breakfast.</p>

<p>“Why,” cried the Boy, “have you really
come back agin?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the robin, “don’t you know
it is almost spring?”</p>

<p>But the Elf Boy did not understand what
he said.</p>

<p>There was a pussy-willow growing by the
brook, and the Boy’s next discovery was that
hundreds of little grey buds were coming out.
He watched them grow bigger from day to
day, and while he was doing this the snow was
melting away in great patches where the sun
shone warmest on the meadow, and the blades
of grass that came up into the daylight were
greener than anything the Elf Boy had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Then the pink buds came on the maple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
trees, and unfolded day by day. And the fruit
trees in the Hermit’s orchard were as white
with blossoms as they had lately been with
snow.</p>

<p>“Not a single tree is dead,” said the Elf
Boy.</p>

<p>Last of all came the wild flowers—blue and
white violets near the brook, dandelions
around the house, and a little later, yellow
buttercups all over the meadow. Slowly but
steadily the world was made over, until it
glowed with white and green and gold.</p>

<p>The Elf Boy was wild with joy. One by
one his old friends came back, and he could
not bear to stay in the house for many minutes
from morning to night. Now he knew what
the wise Hermit had meant by saying, “Be
patient,” and he began to wonder again that
the Hermit could be sorrowful in so beautiful
a world.</p>

<p>One morning the church bells in the village—whose
ringing was the only sound that ever
came from the village over the hill—rang so
much longer and more joyfully than usual, that
the Elf Boy asked the Hermit why they did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
so. The Hermit looked in one of his books,
and answered:</p>

<p>“It is Easter Day. The village people celebrate
it on one Sunday every spring.”</p>

<p>“May we not go also?” asked the Elf Boy,
and as it was the first time he had ever asked
to go to the village, the Hermit could not
refuse to take him.</p>

<p>The village was glowing with flowers.
There were many fruit trees, and they, too,
were in bloom. Every one who passed along
the street seemed either to wear flowers or to
carry them in his hand. The people were all
entering the churchyard; and here the graves,
which had looked so grey and cold when the
Hermit and the Boy had last seen them, were
beautiful with flowers that the village people
had planted or had strewn over them for
Easter.</p>

<p>The people all passed into the church. But
the Hermit and the Elf Boy, who never went
where there was a crowd, stayed outside where
the humming-birds and bees were flying
happily among the flowers. Suddenly there
came from the church a burst of music. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
the Elf Boy it seemed the most beautiful sound
he had ever heard. He put his finger on his
lip to show the Hermit that he wanted to
listen. These were the words they sang:</p>

<p>“<i>I am He that liveth, and was dead; and,
behold, I am alive for evermore!</i>”</p>

<p>The Boy took hold of the Hermit’s hand and
led him to the church door, that they might
hear still better. He was very happy.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he cried, “I do not believe that anything
ever really dies.”</p>

<p>The Hermit looked down at him and
smiled.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” he said.</p>

<p>When the music began again, a strange thing
happened. The Hermit sang the Easter song
with the others. It was the first time he had
sung for many years.</p>

</div>

<p>It happened one day when our Lord sat in
His Paradise creating and painting little birds
that He conceived the idea of making a little
grey bird.</p>

<p>“Remember your name is Robin Redbreast,”
said our Lord to the bird, as soon as
it was finished. Then He held it in the palm
of His open hand and let it fly.</p>

<p>After the bird had been testing his wings
a while, and had seen something of the beautiful
world in which he was destined to live,
he became curious to see what he himself was
like. He noticed that he was entirely grey,
and that his breast was just as grey as all the
rest of him. Robin Redbreast twisted and
turned in all directions as he viewed himself
in the mirror of a clear lake, but he couldn’t
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>find a single red feather. Then he flew back
to our Lord.</p>

<p>Our Lord sat there on His throne, big and
gentle. Out of His hands came butterflies
that fluttered about His head; doves cooed on
His shoulders; and out of the earth beneath
Him grew the rose, the lily, and the daisy.</p>

<p>The little bird’s heart beat heavily with
fright, but with easy curves he flew nearer and
nearer our Lord, till at last he rested on our
Lord’s hand. Then our Lord asked what the
little bird wanted. “I only wish to ask you
about one thing,” said the little bird. “What
is it you wish to know?” said our Lord.
“Why should I be called Redbreast, when
I am all grey from the bill to the very end of
my tail? Why am I called Redbreast when
I do not possess one single red feather?” The
bird looked beseechingly on our Lord with
his tiny black eyes—then turned his head.
About him he saw pheasants all red under a
sprinkle of gold dust, parrots with marvellous
red neckbands, cocks with red combs, to say
nothing about the butterflies, the goldfinches,
and the roses! And naturally he thought how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
little he needed—just one tiny drop of colour
on his breast and he, too, would be a beautiful
bird, and his name would fit him. “Why
should I be called Redbreast when I am so
entirely grey?” asked the bird once again, and
waited for our Lord to say: “Ah, my friend,
I see that I have forgotten to paint your breast
feathers red, but wait a moment and it shall
be done.”</p>

<p>But our Lord only smiled a little and said:
“I have called you Robin Redbreast, and
Robin Redbreast shall your name be, but you
must look to it that you yourself earn your red
breast feathers.” Then our Lord lifted His
hand and let the bird fly once more—out into
the world.</p>

<p>The bird flew down into Paradise, meditating
deeply.</p>

<p>What could a little bird like him do to earn
for himself red feathers? The only thing he
could think of was to make his nest in a brier
bush. He built it in among the thorns in the
close thicket. It looked as if he waited for a
rose leaf to cling to his throat and give him
colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>After many years there dawned a new day,
one that will long be remembered in the
world’s history. On the morning of this day
Robin Redbreast sat upon a little naked hillock
outside of Jerusalem’s walls, and sang to
his young ones, who rested in a tiny nest in a
brier bush.</p>

<p>Robin Redbreast told the little ones all
about that wonderful day of creation, and how
the Lord had given names to everything, just
as each Redbreast had told it ever since the
first Redbreast had heard God’s word, and
gone out of God’s hand. “And mark you,”
he ended sorrowfully, “so many years have
gone, so many roses have bloomed, so many
little birds have come out of their eggs since
Creation Day, but Robin Redbreast is still
a little grey bird. He has not yet succeeded
in gaining his red feathers.”</p>

<p>The little young ones opened wide their tiny
bills, and asked if their forebears had never
tried to do any great thing to earn the priceless
red colour.</p>

<p>“We have all done what we could,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
little bird, “but we have all gone amiss. Even
the first Robin Redbreast met one day another
bird exactly like himself, and he began immediately
to love it with such a mighty love that
he could feel his breast turn. ‘Ah!’ he thought
then, ‘now I understand! It was our Lord’s
meaning that I should love with so much
ardour that my breast should grow red in
colour from the very warmth of the love that
lives in my heart.’ But he missed it, as all
those who came after him have missed it, and
as even you shall miss it.”</p>

<p>The little young ones twittered, utterly bewildered,
and already began to mourn because
the red colour would not come to beautify
their little, downy grey breasts.</p>

<p>“We had also hoped that song would help
us,” said the grown-up bird, speaking in long-drawn-out
tones—“the first Robin Redbreast
sang until his heart swelled within him, he
was so carried away, and he dared to hope
anew. ‘Ah!’ he thought, ‘it is the glow of the
song which lives in my soul that will colour
my breast feathers red.’ But he missed it, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
all the others have missed it and as even you
shall miss it.” Again was heard a sad “peep”
from the young ones’ half-naked throats.</p>

<p>“We had also counted on our courage and
our valour,” said the bird. “The first Robin
Redbreast fought bravely with other birds,
until his breast flamed with the pride of conquest.
‘Ah!’ he thought, ‘my breast feathers
shall become red from the love of battle which
burns in my heart.’ He, too, missed it, as all
those who came after him have missed it, and
as even you shall miss it.” The little young
ones peeped courageously that they still
wished to try and win the much-sought-for
prize, but the bird answered them sorrowfully
that it would be impossible. What
could they do when all other robins had missed
the mark? What could they do more than
love, sing, and fight? What could—the little
bird stopped short, for out of one of the gates
of Jerusalem came a crowd of people marching,
and the whole procession rushed toward
the hillock, where the bird had its nest.
There were riders on proud horses, soldiers
with long spears, executioners with nails and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
hammers. There were judges and priests in
the procession, weeping women, and above all
a mob of mad, loose people running about—a
filthy, howling mob of loiterers.</p>

<p>The little grey bird sat trembling on the
edge of his nest. He feared each instant that
the little brier bush would be trampled down
and his young ones killed!</p>

<p>“Be careful!” he cried to the little defenceless
young ones. “Creep together and remain
quiet. Here comes a horse that will ride right
over us! Here comes a warrior with iron-shod
sandals! Here comes the whole wild,
storming mob!” Immediately the bird ceased
his cry of warning and grew calm and quiet.
He almost forgot the danger hovering over
him. Finally he hopped down into the nest
and spread his wings over the young ones.</p>

<p>“Oh! this is too terrible,” said he. “I don’t
wish you to witness this awful sight! There
are three miscreants who are going to be crucified!”
And he spread his wings so that the
little ones could see nothing.</p>

<p>Robin Redbreast followed the whole spectacle
with his eyes, which grew big with terror.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
He could not take his glance from the three
unfortunates.</p>

<p>“How terrible!” said the bird after a little
while. “They have placed a crown of piercing
thorns upon the head of one of them. I
see that the thorns have wounded his brow so
that the blood flows,” he continued. “And
this man is so beautiful, and looks about him
with such mild glances that every one ought to
love him. I feel as if an arrow were shooting
through my heart, when I see him suffer!”</p>

<p>The little bird began to feel a stronger and
stronger pity for the thorn-crowned sufferer.
“Oh! if I were only my brother the eagle,”
thought he, “I would draw the nails from his
hands, and with my strong claws I would
drive away all those who harm him!” He
saw how the blood trickled down from the
brow of the Crucified One, and he could no
longer remain quiet in his nest. “Even if I
am little and weak, I can still do something for
this poor suffering one,” thought the bird.
Then he left his nest and flew out into the
air, striking wide circles around the Crucified
One. He flew around him several times without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
daring to approach, for he was a shy little
bird, who had never dared to go near a human
being. But little by little he gained courage,
flew close to him, and drew with his little bill
a thorn that had become imbedded in the brow
of the Crucified One. And as he did this there
fell on his breast a drop of blood from the face
of the Crucified One;—it spread quickly and
floated out and coloured all the little fine
breast feathers.</p>

<p>Then the Crucified One opened his lips and
whispered to the bird: “Because of thy compassion,
thou hast won all that thy kind have
been striving after, ever since the world was
created.”</p>

<p>As soon as the bird had returned to his
nest his young ones cried to him: “Thy
breast is red! Thy breast feathers are redder
than the roses!”</p>

<p>And even unto this day the blood-red colour
shines on every Robin Redbreast’s throat and
breast.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_MAPLE_SEED">THE MAPLE SEED</h3>

</div>

<p>On the topmost twig of a maple tree there
grew a seed. In the springtime the gentle
movement of the sap and the soft rustle of the
leaves whispering among themselves had
awakened him; then, day by day, half sleeping
and half conscious, he had fed upon what the
roots provided, stretching himself lazily in the
sunshine. Presently his wing began to unfold.</p>

<p>“That is very curious,” said he, stirring a
little. “It must be a mistake. I don’t flutter
about like the bees.” That bit of wing, which
seemed his and not his, puzzled him. “It
must belong to something else,” he thought.
And afterward he was always on the lookout
for a bee or a dragon fly with only one wing.
But none came.</p>

<p>The hot summer noons and the long moonlit
nights became sultrier and the leaves dropped.
“How withered I am!” said the seed to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
most intimate friend, a leaf that hung from a
near bough. “It makes me feel quite brittle.”
But the leaf did not answer, for just then it
fell from the twig with a queer, reluctant
shiver to the ground.</p>

<p>“Ah!” murmured the maple seed, “I understand.”
So he was not surprised when a
rude breeze twisted him off one day, and sent
him spinning into space.</p>

<p>“Here I go,” thought he, “and this is the
end of it.”</p>

<p>“Puff!” said the breeze, who had seen much
of the world, and looked with contempt upon
the untravelled. “Puff! how ignorant!” and
he blew the seed right into a crack in the earth.</p>

<p>“It must be the end, for all that,” insisted
the seed. No wonder he thought so, for it
was cold and dark where he lay. A troubled
cloud leaned down and wept over him. Then
he began to grow amazingly in the warmth
and moisture.</p>

<p>“If this goes on,” he thought, “I shall certainly
burst, and then I must die. How is one
to live, with a crack in his sides?”</p>

<p>But the maple seed was wrong. He did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
not die. An unsuspected, mysterious strength
sustained him. His roots found food in the
brown earth, and he lifted up a slender stem
into the pure sunlight and warm air.
Through spring, summer, autumn and winter,
year after year, this lived and grew, until the
tiny sapling had become a beautiful tree, with
spreading branches.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the tree, “how stupid I was.”</p>

<p>It was very pleasant on the lawn. An old
couple from the house near by came out in
good weather to sit under the tree. They
reminded him of some fragile leaves he had
seen fluttering somewhere in the past. He
was glad to have them come, and he kept his
coolest shade for them. Partly for their sakes,
he liked to have the robins sing in his branches.</p>

<p>The years went by. The old man tottered
out alone to sit in the cool shadow. He was
bent and sorrowful.</p>

<p>“Ah!” sighed the tree, “I know! I know!
He has lost his leaf, and feels brittle. If I
could only tell him this is not the end!”</p>

<p>After this, many sunny days came, but not
the old man, and the tree concluded that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
had been blown away. “If he only knew that
he would grow again!” he said to himself.
“Unless one knows that, it is so uncomfortable
to lie in the dark.”</p>

<p>A great storm came. The sky blackened,
the winds blew with might, and the heavy rain
fell. The maple was uprooted and broken.
The next day there came men with axes who
cut the tree in pieces, and drew it to the house.</p>

<p>“Is this the end?” he questioned. But no,—the
logs were piled one day in the fireplace
in a large, sunny room. The old man
leaned from his chair to warm his hands by the
cheerful heat the crimson flame gave out. “Is
it the maple?” he said. “Ah! this goes with
the rest.”</p>

<p>The fire grew brighter, burned duller,
turned to embers, smouldered to ashes. The
hearth was cold. The figure was sitting still
in the armchair, but the old man himself had
gone away.</p>

<p>The spirit of the maple whispered, “Does
he know? There is <i>no</i> end.”</p>

<p>There were once two small plants that grew
on the edge of a rough, red ditch. One of
them was an ivy plant and the other a tiny
fig tree.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning when they first
awoke and looked around to see how they liked
the world.</p>

<p>“I think it is an ugly old world,” said the
young fig tree. “I see only a rough, red ditch
with dirty water flowing below.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a beautiful world,” replied the ivy
vine. “I see clouds floating on high, and
sunshine, and such lovely trees and flowers
growing over on the other side of the ditch!
Let us try to make this side beautiful, too.</p>

<p>“I will cover the rough, red places with
pretty, green leaves, and you can decorate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>with your wonderful pink blossoms. Come,
let us try.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the small fig tree, “I would not
waste my time trying to make this ugly old
place beautiful.</p>

<p>“Now if, like my mother, I could have
grown in the soft, rich earth of the garden, I
would have tried to do something, but here
there is no use.”</p>

<p>So, from day to day, the little fig tree
grumbled. Nothing pleased her. If the sun
shone she said it was too hot; if the rain fell
she said it was too wet; and if the wind blew
she said it was too cold.</p>

<p>But with the little ivy vine it was very different,
and she was as happy as a lark from
early morning until night.</p>

<p>“Whether the sun shines or whether the
rains fall, it is God’s will,” said the little
vine, “and I am well pleased. I shall do all
I can to make my side of this ditch beautiful,
and I shall begin to-day.”</p>

<p>And so she did. Though she lived only on
the edge of the red ditch, she spread out her
leaves day by day, running here and there and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
yonder, hiding this red spot and that red spot,
until by and by nothing could be seen but the
beautiful green leaves of the ivy, and she did
not stop until every ugly spot was hidden by
her graceful garlands.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is beautiful, beautiful, now,” cried
the ivy; “only look!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the fig tree, crossly, “but no one
sees it. What are you going to do now?
Dry up, I suppose, since you can never cross
the ditch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I shall cross the ditch,” said the ivy
vine. “I shall keep on trying until I do.
There is so much on the other side I can do
to help make the earth-world beautiful.
Surely there is a way to cross.”</p>

<p>So she ran out little tendrils, reaching here
and there, searching everywhere for a way to
cross the ditch. And at last, by climbing
down to the edge of the muddy water, she
reached a rock half way across, where she
stopped for a moment to rest and wonder what
next to do.</p>

<p>“You’ll never get across,” laughed the fig
tree. “I told you so! You might as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
make up your mind to dry up and stop trying.”</p>

<p>“I shall never stop trying,” called back the
ivy vine. “There is a way to cross all ditches,
and I shall cross this one. Wait and see.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, my pretty one!” said the voice of
the old oak tree close by. “Cling to my roots
there. I am old and worn, but it is a joy to
help one like you; reach out and I will pull
you up.”</p>

<p>So with one huge stretch the ivy vine clung
tightly to the twisted roots of the old oak,
and was soon laughing merrily on the other
side.</p>

<p>“Dear me, but you are a brave little vine,”
said the old oak. “I have been watching you
across the ditch all these months, and you have
changed its ugly, red banks into a real thing
of beauty.</p>

<p>“Now there was a time, once, when flowers
and grasses grew there, and ferns fringed the
edge of the brook, and it was beautiful, indeed.
Every fall I shook armfuls of crimson and
yellow leaves upon the bank, but that was long
ago, before the great forest fire which robbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
me of my limbs and leaves and left me old and
worn.</p>

<p>“What a joy it would be to me if only I
might have my branches decked in leaves one
more time,—especially do I long for this in
the glad springtime, when trees and flowers
are robing themselves for the joyous Easter
Day.</p>

<p>“Sad, indeed, it is to me, to know that I
shall be clothed no more in a fresh dress of
delicate green, like your own pretty leaves,
dear Ivy.”</p>

<p>“But you shall,” said the ivy vine, clapping
her hands; “you have helped me cross the
ditch to-day, and I mean to give you an Easter
dress. Watch me.”</p>

<p>Now vines had never climbed high before
this. They had only run along the ground
and down the hill, and over walls, but this
little ivy vine wrapped her delicate arms
around the rough bark of the old oak, and began
to climb her first tree.</p>

<p>She pulled and stretched, and stretched and
pulled, until little by little, up, up, higher and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
higher she went, leaving a trail of rich, green
leaves behind her. It was a lovely sight.</p>

<p>“See!” she called to the old oak; “I am
bringing you a most beautiful Easter dress,—how
do you like it?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful, beautiful!” laughed the old oak.
“You make me feel young again. But what
will you do when you reach my branches?”</p>

<p>“Why, I shall keep on climbing,” replied
the ivy vine. “When I give a dress at all, it
must be a whole dress, don’t you know? I
shall not stop until I have covered every
branch, as I did the bare spots on the ditch.”</p>

<p>And so she did. Every day she climbed a
little higher, until by and by every limb on the
great, old oak was completely hidden by the
beautiful leaves of the ivy. The old oak
laughed in delight, as she looked on her beautiful
Easter dress of fresh, rich green.</p>

<p>Now the queen of the fairies who, I told
you, was always on the watch for beautiful
deeds, stood under the old oak on Easter Day
and wondered at the beautiful sight. It made
her glad to see the joy of the old oak in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
new dress, and of course she knew who had
given it.</p>

<p>So, turning with a smile to the ivy vine, she
said, “Because you have tried to make others
happy and to make the earth beautiful your
leaves shall never fade. Forever and forever
they shall stay beautiful and green. Cold
shall not hurt them nor summer’s heat destroy
them, and wherever you go you shall gladden
the hearts of men with your freshness and
beauty.”</p>

<p>Very happy, indeed, did these words make
the pretty ivy vine, and ever since she has
been climbing over the earth-world, hunting
bare places to make more beautiful.</p>

<p>Stone walls and churches and houses,—no
place seems too high for her to climb, and
never does she weary in making fresh Easter
dresses for the trees that are old and worn and
cannot make them for themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>Many years ago, in a rocky cave half way up
a steep mountain, there lived a band of robbers.
From the mouth of their cave they
could look far out over the villages of white
houses which dotted the green valley below
to the blue waters of the sea beyond, and between
the villages and the sea there ran a
straight white road. It was there that the
robbers waylaid travellers, robbing them of
money, bales of rich stuff or jewels, until the
band became a terror to the neighbourhood
and the very name of Tibeous, their leader,
was whispered fearfully among travellers.</p>

<p>One clear bright morning Tibeous climbed
down the mountain path alone and mingled,
unrecognised, among the villagers. He was
young and strong and did not look very differently
from the fishermen who, returning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
from a night’s work, were carrying their nets
of shining fish across the beach and through
the narrow streets. Only the eyes of Tibeous
were as keen and suspicious as those of a wild
animal, and often his hand went to his belt
where beneath his cloak of skins he carried,
for protection this time, a sharp dagger.</p>

<p>Through the streets he walked down to the
seashore. There had been heavy rains during
the night, and in the morning sunshine
the tall beach grass sparkled as if hung with
diamonds, the sky was blue and cloudless, and
the dancing waves broke merrily upon the glittering
beach. Watching the peaceful scene
Tibeous forgot for a moment the errand which
had drawn him from his safe retreat. By
listening, unnoticed, to the talk of the village,
he had hoped to learn whether any rich merchants
were expected, so that he and his men
could be ready to waylay them upon the road.
But as he stood upon the beach watching the
barefooted boys play in the waves, a picture of
his own boyhood rose in his mind. He, too,
had lived beside the sea and had helped his
fisherman father draw in nets and carry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
strings of silvery fish. How happy he had
been, he thought, and now for the last five
years the sun seemed to have ceased shining in
his life. His parents had died, and not content
with the small, though honest, living he
made at the fishing, he had fallen in with the
band of robbers. They soon made him their
leader and although younger than any of
them, he was a very good one, for he did not
know what fear was, was ready for any wild
adventure and cared so little for the treasure
he risked his life to steal that he divided it up
among his followers.</p>

<p>But that golden morning Tibeous had forgotten
all this, and as he gazed at a woman
walking toward him with a boy clinging to one
hand and a baby nestled against her shoulder,
he thought only of his own boyhood, and of the
mother who had loved and guarded him. So
intently was he watching the woman that he
did not notice a crowd which was collecting
behind him until, warned by a sudden murmur
of many voices, he turned sharply, his dagger
half drawn. But the men and women had not
noticed him, they were all clustering around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
a white-robed man, and as Tibeous turned
their murmurs died away and they stood motionless,
eagerly listening to the voice of the
figure in their midst. Tibeous could not see
his face, could not at first catch his words, but
the tones of the speaker’s voice reached him,
and like the ripples of the waves and the glimmer
of the sunshine they reminded him afresh
of his own joyous boyhood.</p>

<p>He saw the little boy’s hand tighten in his
mother’s clasp as he urged her forward, and
Tibeous was not surprised; that thrilling voice
seemed to draw all toward it and he, too, followed
the lad. And then, as they reached the
outskirts of the crowd, the men drew back,
making a pathway up to the Master, who,
Tibeous now saw, was already surrounded
with children. The boys and girls were looking
up at him admiringly and even the baby in
its mother’s arms held out its arms, as though
to one to whom it belonged.</p>

<p>Again the Master was speaking, and as
Tibeous gazed, half startled at that beautiful
face, he heard the words:</p>

<p>“Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
receive the kingdom of God as a little child
shall in no wise enter therein.”</p>

<p>“The kingdom of God,” thought Tibeous
with a shudder, how far that was from the
kingdom of robbers over which he ruled on
the wild mountain side. And as far asunder
as those two kingdoms was he, an outlaw and a
thief, from the gracious white-robed man
whose words stirred every heart upon that
shining beach.</p>

<p>From that day Tibeous surprised even his
own rough followers by his recklessness. He
risked capture and death over and over again,
attacking travellers in the daytime as well as
under cover of the night, robbing not only
merchants, but priests and wealthy Pharisees,
men whose power was so great that if the
band was caught, one word would suffice to
hang them all to the nearest trees. But instead
of being captured they only made themselves
hated and feared more than ever. At
length a proclamation went forth promising a
large reward to any man who could bring
Tibeous a prisoner to Jerusalem. As a warning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
to all robbers the thief, if captured, would
be crucified outside the city walls.</p>

<p>None knew that since that one glorious
morning upon the beach, the pain in the heart
of Tibeous had been well-nigh unbearable.</p>

<p>“Such gentle scenes have no place in my
wild life,” he would cry bitterly to himself,
and with the hope of forgetting the picture of
the lad in the Master’s arms he dashed wildly
into every dangerous adventure.</p>

<p>One morning the robber band, looking out
from the cave, saw a multitude of people
journeying toward the mountain, which sloped
down to the far end of the blue sea. Some
came by boat, others rode, while many, who
seemed to be quite poor people, walked.</p>

<p>What could draw them to that out of the
way spot, the robbers wondered, and only
Tibeous suspected the truth. They had probably
travelled so far to meet again the Master
whom he had seen upon the beach. He did
not tell the others of his surmise, but when
they planned to ride around the landward side
of the mountain and rob these people as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
they journeyed home, he refused to go with
them.</p>

<p>“In any dangerous attack,” he said, “I am
always ready to lead you, but as to robbing
poor men and women and children” ... he
turned away disgusted, while again there rose
before him the picture of the mother upon the
beach, bringing her children to that marvellous
man who talked about the kingdom of
God.</p>

<p>Slowly the day passed and the sun sank behind
the mountains while Tibeous sat alone, at
the entrance of the cave, pondering deeply.
He remembered that his mother had often
spoken of a King who would some day come
into the world, a great Deliverer she had
called him, before whom all the nations of the
world would bow and called Him blessed.</p>

<p>Tibeous had wondered at times during the
last weeks whether the glorious white robed
figure could be that King, but this day, as he
sat watching the sun sink, he decided that it
was impossible.</p>

<p>Beautiful the man was and tender and stirring,
but surely, Tibeous thought, no one could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
be a King and a Deliverer without courage
and strength a thousand times greater than
even he, a lion among his followers, possessed.
Could that gracious, gentle figure possess such
miraculous power? “And yet if I thought
for an instant,” he murmured, “that that wonderful
man was the King of whom my mother
dreamed, I would forsake this lawless life and
become his loyal follower.”</p>

<p>At that moment he saw a dark cloud rising
out of the west, the sign of one of the sudden
storms which come so often in that country.
Quickly it spread across the sky, the waves of
the sea grew black and in a few moments they
rose high crested with white foam, and the
wind tore over them, while above the thunder
pealed and the lightning flashed across the
darkness.</p>

<p>Tibeous stood in the cave watching intently.
“Verily,” he exclaimed, “to conquer and subdue
his foes, a great Deliverer must have
power stronger even than this mighty storm.”</p>

<p>A flash of vivid lightning lit up the whole
scene, and in the midst of the furious sea
Tibeous saw a tiny boat. He saw the desperate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
men within it and guessed at their terror.
“Surely,” he thought, “the next wave
will engulf them,” and then walking upon the
storm-tossed waters toward the boat he saw a
figure, his white robes fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p>Again all was darkness while Tibeous stood
before the cave unheeding the torrents of rain
which drenched him, his gaze fixed intently
upon the sea, longing, almost praying, for the
lightning to flash once more and show him
again that mysterious figure.</p>

<p>Another flash, and standing in the stern of
the boat Tibeous saw the white robed man
while the others knelt before him as if in reverence,
and then—there was perfect peace.
The storm died away, the waves were stilled,
and the moon breaking out from behind the
jagged clouds, threw its silvery light upon the
boat sailing quietly across the sea.</p>

<p>“Even the winds and the waves obey him!”
cried Tibeous. “Surely this is the King all
powerful, whom I vowed, if I ever found, to
follow forever.”</p>

<p>Two days later Tibeous was taken prisoner,
carried bound to Jerusalem, and thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
a dark dungeon. With his usual fearlessness
he had searched undisguised, through the villages
for the Deliverer, but before he had
found the Master he was recognised and captured.
Many a weary month he lay in the
prison. At times his restless energy drove
him almost crazy, and he would rush up and
down his narrow cell like a caged beast. At
other times, when the first beams of early
dawn pierced the narrow slit in the stone wall,
which was his only window, or when a silvery
ray of moonlight struggled through, the scenes
of his wild life seemed blotted out, and he
thought only of the Christ, and of his kingdom
to which now, alas, he could never belong.</p>

<p>He supposed first it was an earthly kingdom,
full of brave soldiers who would fight
for the great King, to whom at last all the
nations of the world would bow. But one
morning, after nearly a year of imprisonment,
he was taken out of his dark cell and led, his
hands bound with leathern thongs, toward a
green hill outside the city walls. Beside him
walked another prisoner, a coarse, savage-looking
man, well known for his brutal deeds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
and upon the shoulders of each of them was
laid a heavy cross. Upon those crosses they
were to be crucified.</p>

<p>Tibeous was wan and pale from his long
imprisonment, but in his eyes, which gleamed
out of his white face, there was no look of
fear or hate. He was as willing to die as to
linger on hopeless in the dungeon. The vision
of the great Deliverer on which he had dwelt
for so long seemed to fill his soul, his one longing
was to serve him, and as that was impossible
he had nothing else to live for.</p>

<p>When they left the prison the sky was blue
and clear, but as they reached the foot of the
green hill dark, threatening clouds hung over
them. The two prisoners paused there, resting
upon the ground the heavy crosses under
which they had staggered, and then up the
road from the city-gate another procession
came toward them. There were priests in
long robes, soldiers in red cloaks and shining
armour, women—sobbing, many of them—and
fishermen and peasants walking side by side
with wealthy publicans and Pharisees.</p>

<p>In the midst of the crowd walked a white-robed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
figure, and Tibeous caught his breath
in astonished wonder. Could it be, yes it was,
the King, the great Deliverer, who had drawn
crowds to him upon the sunlit beach, and who
by his great power had stilled the raging
storm. And yet he was here to-day as a prisoner,
his hands bound and his garments torn,
while before him walked a man bearing the
cross on which the Christ, like a common
thief or murderer, was to be crucified.</p>

<p>“But he looks more like a King than ever,”
thought the bewildered Tibeous, and then he
understood!</p>

<p>Around the Master pressed those who belonged
to the kingdom of this world, their
faces cruel, or evil, or merely weak, and among
them the Lord whom they had bound walked
as fearlessly and graciously as a young king
on his way to be crowned. But others, the
poor fishermen and many of the women, seem
to have caught his look of perfect goodness.
They were frightened and heartbroken as they
gazed at their King who was so soon to be
taken from them, but they belonged to him, to
his kingdom which was not of this world, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
their faces, in spite of their sorrow, were full
of childlike faith and trust.</p>

<p>Up the hill streamed the procession, Tibeous
and his companion, with their guard of soldiers,
walking slowly behind.</p>

<p>And then followed the deed at which
through all the centuries that have passed
since then men and women have shuddered
with awestruck horror.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, the Deliverer of the world,
was nailed upon a cross, while upon two other
crosses, one on his right and one on his left,
hung the dying robbers. “With righteous
wrath will he not denounce his murderers?”
thought Tibeous, and then Jesus spoke:
“Father, forgive them,” he said, “for they
know not what they do.” And during the
following hours of anguish he uttered no word
of anger or condemnation. “How like a king
he is even here,” thought Tibeous. “Above
the mocking, cruel crowd he hangs, unmoved
by pain, glorious, noble, kingly to the end.
Soon my life will be over and I shall never
see that wonderful face again. Ah! if for
one moment only I might feel that I have belonged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
to his kingdom. I, a miserable dying
thief, who richly deserves this bitter agony.”</p>

<p>Then as the crowd jeered at the Master,
crying, “He saved others, let him save himself
if he be Christ, the chosen one of God!”,
the other robber mocked him also.</p>

<p>“If thou be Christ save thyself and us!” he
said.</p>

<p>But Jesus answered not a word, and Tibeous
cried to the robber:</p>

<p>“Dost thou not fear God, seeing thou art
in the same condemnation? And we, indeed,
justly, for we receive the due reward of our
deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiss.”</p>

<p>Then turning his pain-dimmed eyes toward
Jesus he gazed with adoration and longing
upon the face of the glorious dying Master.</p>

<p>“Jesus,” he said, his voice trembling with
wistful entreaty, “Lord, remember me when
thou comest into thy kingdom.”</p>

<p>And Jesus, gazing back at him with tender
compassion, answered slowly:</p>

<p>“Verily I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou
be with me in paradise.”</p>

<p>The terrible hours wore away and then—we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
know no more, but can we not picture to ourselves
a faint glimmer of the glory into which
that very day Tibeous entered?</p>

<p>Jesus had said, “Whosoever shall not receive
the kingdom of God as a little child shall in
no wise enter therein.” And it seems to me
that when, in the twilight, the spirit of Tibeous
entered the kingdom of heaven, all his wild
and selfish life was forgotten, and he was like
a little lad again at his mother’s side. Surely
his mother was waiting for him there, her
arms outstretched with tender longing, and
we know that he was with Jesus, the glorious
King, the Light of Life, the Joy of the World.</p>

<p>And so to Tibeous, the dying thief, there
came the glory of Easter.</p>

</div>

<p>When Jesus grew to be a man He went about
teaching the people how to live. Many loved
Jesus and believed what He told them. But
some doubted His words, while others were
unkind and even cruel. At last some wicked
people believed it was unwise to let Jesus live
and teach; and they hanged Him upon a
cross. All His friends were very sad after
they had seen Him die. They wrapped His
body in linen clothes and laid Him in a tomb
in a garden. A great rock was rolled in front
of the tomb and soldiers were placed to
guard the way day and night; for the wicked
people who had killed Jesus did not wish any
of His friends to take His body away.</p>

<p>All night and all the next day the soldiers
watched at the tomb. The second night a
strange and wonderful light came slowly in
the east and some little birds began to sing
beautiful songs. Suddenly, there was a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
noise and a shaking of the ground and a beautiful
angel came down from heaven, rolled the
stone away from the tomb and Jesus came
forth! Two beautiful angels stood at the door
to meet Him and with them He walked away
through the garden.</p>

<p>When the friends of Jesus came to the tomb
early in the morning they saw a wonderful
sight. “Behold,” said one, pointing to the
garden near the tomb, “pure white lilies have
come forth.” “And behold!” said the other,
“where pure white lilies mark the footsteps of
Jesus and the angels.”</p>

<p>Two little souls were speeding their outward
way from God. Angels folded their white
wings in wondering silence, and watched the
little ones go forth upon their unknown mission.
The sky parted to let them pass, and
“trailing clouds of glory” the two souls swept
on into that unmeasured space where there is
no light but the stars, and no sound but the
voice of their harmonies. Then the two little
souls spoke. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked each of the other.</p>

<p>“I am Spirit,” “I am Life,” they made
answer.</p>

<p>“It is all one,” sang the little souls together.
“We are the same. We came from God; we
are going to dwell with men.”</p>

<p>So they sang very happily as they sped
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>along, and their voices were attuned to the
music of the great spheres.</p>

<p>When the little souls reached the earth they
said good-bye to each other, for each little soul
had a house of his own. Not an immovable
house made of wood and stone, but a tiny
tabernacle that could be moved about. It was
made of flesh and blood and skin and soft
bones. It was the form of a little child.</p>

<p>“Oh, how nice!” cried each little soul,
quickly speeding through the house from top
to toe, and pulling the strings which set the
breath to coming and going, and the little
fingers and toes to quirking and nestling.</p>

<p>“I must take a peep out of the windows,”
cried each little soul, as he pulled up the curtains
and looked out. “Oho! our baby has
blue eyes like the violets,” shouted the noisy
children.</p>

<p>“Ah, the Prince looks upon us; his Royal
Highness has eyes like his father the King,”
said the grand courtiers, speaking low, with
deep reverence, for one of the little souls had
found its home in a peasant’s hut, the other
in the palace of a great king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span></p>

<p>The little souls never saw one another again
until they had spent their time on earth and
were flying back to God. Again they were
speeding their way through the unmeasured
spaces of the stars.</p>

<p>The souls knew each other, remembering
the time when they had gone out from God
to dwell among men. They gazed with joy
at each other, for these returning souls were
full of gracious loveliness, such as earthly eyes
have not seen.</p>

<p>“Sweet Life, you are no longer a little soul,”
said Spirit; “you are strong and beautiful; you
must have dwelt in a great house.” “Ay,”
replied Life, serenely, “it was a perfect house,
for the greatest of builders made it for me.”</p>

<p>“Then it was spacious and lofty and beautiful,
and it stood in a high and sunny space?”</p>

<p>“Oh no; it was none of these,” replied Life.
“It was narrow and infirm, and it trembled
in the blast. No one who saw it desired it.
But I loved it because it was the Gift of God,
and I was so thankful. It stood in a deep
valley, the shadows of the mountains made
it dark, and I could not look far away. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
could not look down: there was only one way
to look, and that was up, and my light came
not from this side or that, but straight down
from the Father of Lights, and so I was a
shining one, though I lived in a dark place.”</p>

<p>“What did you do in your house?”</p>

<p>“Always I toiled and served and suffered
and loved, for some needed me who were
poorer and weaker than I. Sometimes I was
hungry and thirsty and in pain, but oftener I
shared my loaf and cup, and helped the pain
of others, and I kept the door ajar so that
the poor and troubled ones, those who were
cast down and ashamed, could come in without
knocking and rest in a warm place; and
they loved me—the poor, the weak, and the
little ones. They are weeping now because
my house is empty, and I shall look out of
the windows no more: it is cold, the hearth
fire can never glow again. But my house
was weak and crumbling down upon me. I
could stay no longer. So I came away and
left it fallen, prone upon the ground—earth
to earth.”</p>

<p>“My house,” said the Spirit, “was not like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
that; it was noble and strong. It stood on
high among the kings of the earth, and looked
over my broad dominions. My house had
towers of strength and halls of bounty and
fair gardens with pleasant fruits. Every one
who saw it desired it for its beauty and feared
it for its strength. It could not be shaken in
the rudest blasts, and the shock of war could
not make it tremble or force its gates.”</p>

<p>“What did you do in your house?”</p>

<p>“Always, like you, I toiled and served and
suffered and loved, but not like you in the
way of doing, for I was a king with sceptre
and crown, and what I did was done in the
royal manner. I could not share my cup and
loaf with the hungry, nor lay my hand on the
brow of pain as you did, but I could make laws
and find out wisdom that would strengthen
the land and bring bread and meat and health
to my poor people. I could not take the suffering
ones into my own house as you did,
for they were many and my house was but
one; but my house should stand a castle in
their behalf—a stronghold and defence—and
so standing it met its doom; in the prime of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
its glory it reeled, turret and foundation, beneath
the onslaught of the oppressor, and with
a great fall it lay prone on the battle-ground,
crumbling back to earth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A herald went through the land crying,
“The King is dead! the King is dead!”</p>

<p>“So is good Barbara,” answered the peasants.
“She was born the same night as the
King, and she died the same day.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two souls swept on through the wide
spaces of the stars, on and on through the
pearly gates of heaven. Angels folded their
wings, and looked with tender awe upon these
gracious beings who had come from the earth.</p>

<p>“We cannot tell who they are,” said the
angels.</p>

<p>“One was a King. One was a peasant.
But one cannot tell which was the King and
which was the peasant,” said the angels:
“these beings are alike wondrous fair and
noble.”</p>

<p>The two souls swept on, with equal stroke
of their shining wings, through the serried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
ranks of the heavenly host, and God did not
welcome these home-coming souls as king or
peasant, but He gave to each a new name—the
new name which He has promised to him that
overcometh.</p>

<p>Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good,
and His mercy endureth forever. Sing unto
Him a new song, for He causeth the desert
to put forth blossoms, and the valleys He
covereth with greenness. Out of the night
He bringeth day, and out of death life everlasting.
On this day a new light is upon the

<p>The bands of winter are broken in sunder,
and the land is made soft with showers.
Easter day bringeth the children of men near
to the source of all light; for on this day the
Lord declareth the permanence of His world,
and maketh known the immortality of the
soul. He hath revealed the life everlasting
and His goodness endureth forever. Easter
is the promise of the Lord that all the best and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
noblest in man shall be renewed, even as
growth and bloom and ripening shall not
cease. The bars of winter are broken, and the
iron bands of death are riven. The bird is
on the wing and the flight of the soul shall
know no weariness. The lilies lift their holy
white grails brimmed with the sunshine of
God’s love. For, has not the Lord manifested
His love in flowers and in the upspringing of
green things? They are sweet interpreters of
large certainties. Each year the winter cuts
them down and each spring they put forth
again. Each spring is a new page in the book
of revelation, wherever we read that life is an
eternal genesis, and its end is not; for it endureth
forever.</p>

<p>“I am frightened,” said Mytyl.</p>

<p>“I am never frightened,” said Tyltyl, shaking
with fear.</p>

<p>“Are the dead alive?” asked Mytyl.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tyltyl, “they’re not alive.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to see them?”</p>

<p>“Of course; Light said so.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?” asked Mytyl.</p>

<p>“Here, under the grass or under those big
stones, Mytyl.”</p>

<p>“Are those the stones of their houses?”
asked Mytyl.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When will you turn the diamond, Tyltyl?”</p>

<p>“Light said I was to wait until midnight.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it midnight yet?”</p>

<p>Tyltyl looked at the church clock. “Listen,
it is going to strike.”</p>

<p>Above the children the tones of the clock
boomed out as it started to strike twelve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span></p>

<p>“I want to go away, Tyltyl! I want to go
away!”</p>

<p>“Not now, Mytyl; I am going to turn the
diamond.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried Mytyl. “Don’t! I’m so
frightened, Brother! I want to go away.”</p>

<p>Tyltyl tried vainly to lift his hand; he could
not reach the diamond with Mytyl clinging to
him.</p>

<p>“I am so frightened.”</p>

<p>Poor Tyltyl was quite as frightened as she,
but at each trial his courage had grown
greater.</p>

<p>The eleventh stroke rang out. “The hour
is passing. It is time,” and, releasing himself
from Mytyl’s arms he turned the diamond.</p>

<p>A moment of suspense followed for the poor
children, Mytyl hid her face in Tyltyl’s
breast.</p>

<p>“They’re coming,” she cried. “They’re
coming.”</p>

<p>Tyltyl shut his eyes and leaned against a
heavy stone beside him. The children remained
in that position for a minute, hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
daring to breathe. Then they heard birds
singing, a warm scented breeze fanned their
faces and on hands and neck they felt the soft
heat of the balmy summer sun. Reassured, but
finding it hard to believe in so great a miracle,
they opened their eyes and looked about them.
From all the open tombs were rising thousands
of delicate flowers gradually growing more
and more tall and plentiful and marvellous.
Little by little they spread everywhere, over
the paths, over the grass, transforming the rude
little graveyard into a fairylike garden. Its
sweet-scented breeze was murmuring in the
young and tender leaves, the birds were singing
and the bees humming gaily above glittering
dew and opening flowers.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it! It’s not possible!” cried
Tyltyl.</p>

<p>The two children, holding each other by the
hand, walked through what had been the
graveyard, but where now no graveyard was
to be seen. Vainly they searched among the
flowers for a trace of the low mounds, stone
slabs, and wooden crosses so lately there. In
the presence of the truth they saw that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
their fears of the dead were foolish. They
saw that there are no dead; but that life goes
on always only under fresh form. The fading
rose sheds its pollen only to give birth to
other roses, and its scattered petals scent the
air. The fruits come when the blossoms fall
from the trees; when the grub dies the brilliant
butterfly is born. Nothing perishes;
there are only changes.</p>

<p>Beautiful birds circled about Tyltyl and
Mytyl. There were no blue ones among
them, but the two children were so happy over
their discovery that they asked for nothing
more.</p>

<p>Relieved and delighted they kept repeating:</p>

<p>“There are no dead! There are no dead!”</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
